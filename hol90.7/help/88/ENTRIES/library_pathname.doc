\DOC library_pathname

\TYPE {library_pathname : (void -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the pathname to the current library directory.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {library_pathname()} returns a string giving the root pathname of
the current library directory.  Usually, this is just the absolute pathname 
to the HOL system library.  But during the evaluation of a call to
{load_library}, the string returned by {library_pathname()} is the library
directory in which the library being loaded resides.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
A very typical application is illustrated by the following code from the
load file for the built-in {string} library:
{
   let path = library_pathname() ^ `/string/` in
       set_search_path (union (search_path()) [path]);;
}
\noindent When the {string} library load file is loaded using {load_library},
this part of the code adds the pathname to the {string} library to the internal
HOL search path.

\USES
The main purpose of the function {library_pathname} is to allow library
load files to update the internal HOL search paths in a site-independent way.

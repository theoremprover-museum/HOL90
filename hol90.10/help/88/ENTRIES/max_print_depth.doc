\DOC max_print_depth

\TYPE {max_print_depth : (int -> int)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets depth of block nesting.

\DESCRIBE
The function {max_print_depth} is used to define the maximum depth of
nesting that the pretty printer will allow. If the number of blocks
is greater than the the value set by {max_print_depth} then
the blocks are truncated and this is indicated by the holophrast {&}.
The function always returns the previous maximum depth setting.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
\noindent If the maximum depth setting is the default (500) and we want to
change this to 20 the command will be:
{
   #max_print_depth 20;;
}
\noindent The system will then return the following:
{
   500 : int
}

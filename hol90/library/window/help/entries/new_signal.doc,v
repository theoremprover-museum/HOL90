@\DOC new_signal

\TYPE {new_signal : (unit -> '1a signal)}

\SYNOPSIS
Creates a new signal.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
The function {new_signal} is used to creat new signals.  These
signals can then have functions associated with them that will be
evaluated whenever the signal is raised.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The signals used by the window inference library are declared as
follows:
{
(* This signal should be raised when a new stack is begun.          *)
val beg_stack_sig : string signal = new_signal ()
(* This signal should be raised when a stack is killed.             *)
and end_stack_sig : string signal = new_signal ()
(* This signal should be raised when the current stack is changed.  *)
and set_stack_sig : string signal = new_signal ();

(* This signal should be raised when window is pushed on the stack. *)
val psh_win_sig : unit signal = new_signal ()
(* This signal is raised when a window is popped off the stack.     *)
and pop_win_sig : unit signal = new_signal ()
(* This signal should be raised whener the top window is changed.   *)
and cng_win_sig : unit signal = new_signal ();
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

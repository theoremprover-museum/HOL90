@\DOC RESQ_REWRITE1_CONV

\TYPE {RESQ_REWRITE1_CONV : thm list -> thm -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewriting conversion using a restricted universally quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, rewriting, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
{RESQ_REWRITE1_CONV} is a rewriting conversion similar to
{COND_REWRITE1_CONV}. The only difference is the rewriting theorem it
takes. This should be an equation with restricted universal
quantification at the outer level. It is converted to a theorem in the
form accepted by the conditional rewriting conversion.

Suppose that {th} is the following theorem
{
   A |- !x::P. Q[x] = R[x])
}
\noindent evaluating {RESQ_REWRITE1_CONV thms th "t[x']"}
will return a theorem
{
   A, P x' |- t[x'] = t'[x']
}
\noindent where {t'} is the result of substituting instances of
{R[x'/x]} for corresponding instances of {Q[x'/x]} in the original
term {t[x]}. All instances of {P x'} which 
do not appear in the original assumption {asml} are added to the assumption.
The theorems in the list {thms} are used to eliminate the instances {P
x'} if it is possible.

\FAILURE
{RESQ_REWRITE1_CONV}  fails if {th} cannot be transformed into the
required form by the function {RESQ_REWR_CANON}. Otherwise, it fails if no 
match is found or the theorem cannot be instantiated.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC load_theorem

\TYPE {load_theorem : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in a given theorem from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, and {th} one of its axioms, then
{
   load_theorem `thy` `th`
}
\noindent will attempt to load the corresponding theorem, that is, to perform
dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let th = theorem `thy` `th`;;
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {th} is not one of its
theorems.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_theorem `bool` `PAIR`;;
() : void

PAIR = |- !x. FST x,SND x = x

#PAIR;;
|- !x. FST x,SND x = x
}
\USES
Useful for autoloading.

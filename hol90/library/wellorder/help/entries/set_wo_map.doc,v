@\DOC set_wo_map

\TYPE {set_wo_map : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets interface map for constants in the ``wellorder'' library.

\LIBRARY wellorder

\DESCRIBE
To increase flexibility, the constants used in the wellorder library are
declared with a {wo_} prefix. The {set_wo_map} function sets up an interface
map to eliminate them from view. Any existing interface map is preserved
alongside. The constants which have their prefixes hidden are: {subset},
{Union}, {fl}, {poset}, {chain}, {woset} and {inseg}.

\FAILURE
Fails if an entry in the new interface map clashes with an existing one.

\COMMENTS
The interface map is not set up by default when the library is loaded.

\SEEALSO
interface_map, set_interface_map, unset_wo_map.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

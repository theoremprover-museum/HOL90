@\DOC preterm_var

\TYPE {preterm_var : (string -> preterm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs variable preterm.

\DESCRIBE
{preterm_var} is analogous to the oft-used ML function {mk_var}.  Since,
however, preterms are untypechecked terms, the restrictions imposed when
using {mk_var} (i.e. that the variable must be either implicitly or
explicitly associated with a specific type) are not encountered until
the preterm is typechecked.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#preterm_var `x`;;
preterm_var `x` : preterm

#preterm_to_term it;;
Indeterminate types:  "x:?"

evaluation failed     types indeterminate

#preterm_typed(preterm_var `x`,":bool");;
preterm_typed((preterm_var `x`), ":bool") : preterm

#preterm_to_term it;;
"x" : term
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

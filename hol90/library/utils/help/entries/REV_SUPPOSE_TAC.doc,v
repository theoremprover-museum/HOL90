\TYPE
{
REV_SUPPOSE_TAC : term -> tactic
}

\LIBRARY utils

\SYNOPSIS
A tactic for adding an assumption to a goal, with the condition
that the assumption be proved first.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {REV_SUPPOSE_TAC t} when applied to a goal {([a1,...,an],Goal)}
returns the two subgoals
{
   ([a1,...,an],t)

   ([t,a1,...,an],Goal)
}
\noindent The differnce between {REV_SUPPOSE_TAC} and {SUPPOSE_TAC} is the
order in which they return the subgoals.


\FAILURE
The tactic {REV_SUPPOSE_TAC} fails if it is not given a term of type
{(==`:bool`==)}.

\EXAMPLE
{
   SUPPOSE_TAC (--`?n. INT n = MIN`--)
}
\noindent when applied to the goal
{
   ([(--`POS MIN`--)], (--`?x:num. Y = ((MAX times (INT x)) plus REM)`--))
}
returns the two subgoals
{
   ([(--`POS MIN`--)], (--`?n. INT n = MIN`--))

   ([(--`?n. INT n = MIN`--), (--`POS MIN`--)],
   (--`?x. Y = ((MAX times (INT x)) plus REM)`--))
}

\USES
Adding lemmas as assumptions to a goal to assists in its proof.
{REV_SUPPOSE_TAC} allows you to inline the proof of a fairly short easy
lemma while proving a theorem using the goal stack, and then return to your
original proof with the lemma available as an assumption.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {new_infix : ((string # type) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new infix constant in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_infix(`i`,":ty")} makes {i} an infix
constant in the current theory. Note that it does not specifiy its value.
The constant may have a polymorphic type, which may be arbitrarily
instantiated. Like any other infix or binder, its special parse status may be
suppressed by preceding it with a dollar sign.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode, or if the name is not a valid constant
name, or there is already a constant of that name in the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows the use of the curried form as well as the infix:
{
   #new_theory `groke`;;
   () : void

   #new_infix(`orelse`,":bool->bool->bool");;
   () : void

   #"T orelse F";;
   "T orelse F" : term

   #"$orelse T F";;
   "T orelse F" : term
}

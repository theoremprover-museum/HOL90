@\DOC FINITE_CONV

\TYPE {FINITE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves finiteness of sets of the form {"{{x1,...,xn}}"}.

\LIBRARY pred_sets

\DESCRIBE 
The conversion {FINITE_CONV} expects its term argument to be an assertion of
the form {"FINITE {{x1,...,xn}}"}. Given such a term, the conversion returns
the theorem
{
   |- FINITE {{x1,...,xn}} = T
}

\EXAMPLE
{
#FINITE_CONV "FINITE {{1,2,3}}";;
|- FINITE{{1,2,3}} = T

#FINITE_CONV "FINITE ({{}}:num->bool)";;
|- FINITE{{}} = T
}

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {"FINITE {{x1,...,xn}}"}.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

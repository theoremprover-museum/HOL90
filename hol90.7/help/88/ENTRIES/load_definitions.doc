\DOC load_definitions

\TYPE {load_definitions : (string -> void list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in all the definitions from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, then the call
{
   load_definitions `thy`
}
\noindent attempts to load in all the definitions of that theory, that is, for
each definition {def}, to perform dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let def = definition `thy` `def`;;
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless {thy} is an ancestor theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_definitions `combin`;;
[(); (); (); ()] : void list

I_DEF = |- I = S K K

S_DEF = |- S = (\f g x. f x(g x))

K_DEF = |- K = (\x y. x)

o_DEF = |- !f g. f o g = (\x. f(g x))
}

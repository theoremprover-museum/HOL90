\DOC resituate_hol90

\SYNOPSIS
A unix utility useful when moving the hol90 root directory after the system 
has been built.

\DESCRIBE
If one moves the hol90 directory after the system has been built, many things
will stop working, since the internal paths used by the system will no
longer be accurate. {resituate_hol90} reconfigures an hol90 image to a new 
root directory. In the following, we assume that the new hol90 root directory
is {/dir0/dir1/.../hol90}. {resituate_hol90} is called from unix directly.
It has the following call format
{
    ..../tools/resituate_hol90 <from-image> <to-image> <path>
}
where {<from-image>} is a path to an hol90 image, {<to-image>} is the 
path where the "resituated" image is to be written, and {<path>} is the
new root directory for the system. An invocation of {resituate_hol90} 
resets the HOLdir, help_path, theory_path, and library_path to take
account of the new root directory for the system, and then writes the 
image to {<to-image>}.

\EXAMPLE
On a sun4 one could invoke
{
    % tools/resituate_hol90 src/hol90.sparc src/hol90.sparc 
                            /usr/local/lib/hol90.5
}
to readjust the sun4 version of hol90 to think that the hol90 root directory
is /usr/local/lib/hol90.5

\FAILURE
Note that the example invocation will overwrite the file of an executing
process (namely src/hol90.sparc). Some operating systems may not allow this,
in which case one needs to use a "temporary" <to-image>. A command like
{
    (tools/resituate_hol90 src/hol90.sparc src/hol90.tmp 
                           /usr/local/lib/hol90.5; 
     mv src/hol90.tmp src/hol90.sparc)
}
\noindent ought to work. 

\COMMENTS
Needs to be invoked on each architecture of interest, i.e., for each 
hol90.<arch> in the "src" directory of the hol90 distribution.

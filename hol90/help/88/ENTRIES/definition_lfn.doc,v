@\DOC definition_lfn

\TYPE {definition_lfn : (string list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads a given definition from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is an ancestor theory, and {def} one of its definitions, then the
call
{
   definition_lfn [`thy`;`def`]
}
\noindent will return that definition.

\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {def} is not one of its
definitions.

\EXAMPLE
{
#definition_lfn [`bool`; `EXISTS_DEF`];;
|- $? = (\P. P($@@ P))
}
\COMMENTS
This call has the same effect as {definition `thy` `def`}.

\SEEALSO
definition, definitions, definition_msg_lfn, load_definition, load_definitions.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

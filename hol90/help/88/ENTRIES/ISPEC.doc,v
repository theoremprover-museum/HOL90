@\DOC ISPEC

\TYPE {ISPEC : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes a theorem, with type instantiation if necessary.

\KEYWORDS
rule, type.

\DESCRIBE
This rule specializes a quantified variable as does {SPEC}; it differs
from it in also instantiating the type if needed:
{
     A |- !x:ty.tm
  -----------------------  ISPEC "t:ty'"
      A |- tm[t/x]
}
\noindent (where {t} is free for {x} in {tm}, and {ty'} is an instance
of {ty}).

\FAILURE
{ISPEC} fails if the input theorem is not universally quantified, if
the type of the given term is not an instance of the type of the
quantified variable, or if the type variable is free in the
assumptions.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

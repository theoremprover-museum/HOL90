@\DOC PCHOOSE

\TYPE {PCHOOSE : ((term # thm) -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, existential.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates paired existential quantification using deduction from a
particular witness.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-theorem pair {(q,A1 |- ?p. s)} and a second
theorem of the form {A2 u {{s[q/p]}} |- t}, the inference rule {PCHOOSE}
produces the theorem {A1 u A2 |- t}.
{
    A1 |- ?p. s   A2 u {{s[q/p]}} |- t
   ------------------------------------  PCHOOSE ("q",(A1 |- ?q. s))
               A1 u A2 |- t
}
\noindent Where no variable in the paired variable structure {q} is free in
{A1}, {A2} or {t}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the terms and theorems correspond as indicated above; in
particular {q} must have the same type as the pair existentially
quantified over, and must not contain any variable free in {A1}, {A2} or {t}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

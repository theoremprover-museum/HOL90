   (* ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    * COND_REWR_CONV : thm -> (term -> thm) -> conv
    * 
    * Build a conversion based on a conditional rewrite theorem.  
    * The theorem must be of the form
    *       A |- P1 ==> ... Pm ==> (Q[x1,...,xn] = R[x1,...,xn])
    * The conversion matches the input term against Q, using limited
    * higher order matching.  This instantiates
    * x1 ... xn, which the conversion then solves with the solver provided.
    * If any of the conditions are not solved COND_REWR_CONV fails.
    *
    * The theorem can be a permutative rewrite, such as
    *      |- (x = y) = (y = x)
    *      |- (x + y) = (y + x)
    * In these cases the rewrite will only get applied if the ordering
    * of the variables in the term is not in strictly ascending order,
    * according to a term_lt function which places a total ordering
    * on terms.  (Nb. term_lt is broken in hol90.7, so I have to
    * work with my own version here, which is not so efficient.  Also,
    * the term ordering needs to be "AC" compatible - see Termord).
    *
    * FAILURE CONDITIONS
    *
    * Fails if any of the assumptions cannot be solved by the solver,
    * or if the term does not match the rewrite in the first place.
    * ---------------------------------------------------------------------*)

\TYPE {PEXT : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, extensionality.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Derives equality of functions from extensional equivalence.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t1 p = t2 p},
the inference rule {PEXT} returns the theorem {A |- t1 = t2}.
{
    A |- !p. t1 p = t2 p
   ----------------------  PEXT          [where p is not free in t1 or t2]
        A |- t1 = t2
}

\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem does not have the form indicated above, or
if any of the component variables in the paired variable structure {p}
is free either of the functions {t1} or {t2}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#PEXT (ASSUME "!(x,y). ((f:(*#*)->*) (x,y)) = (g (x,y))");;
. |- f = g
}

\chapter{The wellorder library}

The wellorder library develops a small theory of orderings, particularly
wellorderings. This theory is used to prove a theorem justifying definitions by
recursion over a wellordering. One can use an arbitrary recursion equation:

\begin{session}\begin{alltt}
?!f. !a. f(a) = h f a
\end{alltt}\end{session}

provided one can show that the value of {\tt h f a} depends only on the
values of {\tt f} for values with lower measure than {\tt a}, where the measure
is some function into the range of a wellordering.

The library also contains some frequently used forms of the Axiom Of Choice,
namely:

\begin{itemize}

\item The Well-Ordering Principle: every set can be well-ordered.

\item Hausdorff's Maximal Principle: every poset has a maximal chain.

\item Zorn's Lemma: a poset in which every chain has an upper bound contains a
maximal element.

\item Kuratowski's Lemma: every chain in a poset is contained in a maximal
chain.

\end{itemize}

The names attached to the above theorems are probably the most conventional,
but are no indication of priority. In fact the `maximal' principles were
independently discovered by various people. The Well-Ordering theorem was first
stated by Cantor, who regarded it as self-evident, and first proved by Zermelo
using the Axiom Of Choice. More details of the history of the Axiom of Choice
can be found in \cite{moore}.

The HOL logic includes a strong form of the Axiom as standard (namely
{\tt SELECT\_AX} which specifies the behaviour of ther Hilbert
$\varepsilon$-operator). From this, the above four theorems are deduced.
The proofs are not original: they mainly follow the proofs in the set theory
chapter of Dudley's book \cite{dudley}, with a few ideas (e.g. the simple
characterization of wellordering) taken from \cite{stoll}. The latter book,
like \cite{DP}, proves the results in a different way starting from a fixpoint
theorem for CPOs due to Bourbaki \cite{bourbaki}. However the proof of that
theorem is rather ugly.

\section{Loading the library}

Assuming \HOL\ is installed properly, it is only necessary to execute the
following \ML\ command:

\begin{session}\begin{alltt}
#load_library `wellorder`;;
\end{alltt}\end{session}

The theorems and definitions are then set up to autoload as described latter in
this document.

\section{Basic definitions and theorems in the wellorder library}

The theorems in the library are all couched in terms of ordering relations, so
the library begins with some preliminary definitions concerned with ordered
sets. To make it easier for a user to massage the theorems as required for a
particular application, all the definitions are prefixed with {\tt wo\_} so
they are unlikely to clash with any others. The library provides functions {\tt
set\_wo\_map} and {\tt unset\_wo\_map} to set and remove an interface map to
hide this from the user. In the succeeding discussion, we ignore {\tt wo\_}
prefixes.

\subsection{Definitions about sets}

We consider predicates as sets rather than define a new type. In the following
discussion, we will generally use set notation: $x \in P$ rather than
$P x$ or $P(x)$. The only two purely set-theoretic definitions made are:

\begin{itemize}

\item $ P \subseteq Q \equiv \forall x.\ x \in P \implies x \in Q $

\item $ \Union P \equiv \lambda x.\ \exists p.\ p \in P \logand x \in p $

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Definitions about orders}

The usual definition of an ordered set is a pair $(P,\leq)$ where
$\leq$ is a subset of the Cartesian product $P \times P$. Continual
manipulation of pairs makes the proofs rather more awkward, so we identify an
ordered set with the $\leq$ relation itself. (In the following, we will for
example use the terms `wellorder' and `woset' without discrimination.) If
required, the underlying set $P$ can be recovered by the $fl$ (field) function,
defined as:

$$ fl(\leq) x = \exists y.\ x \leq y \logor y \leq x $$

Since orders (partial or otherwise) are always symmetric, this is equivalent to

$$ fl(\leq) x = x \leq x $$

However it is useful to have the above definition available to prove something
{\em is} an order.

Now a partially ordered set (poset) is defined to be a binary relation which is
reflexive, transitive and antisymmetric:

$$ poset(\leq) =
  \ba (\forall x \in fl(\leq).\ x \leq x) \logand                              \\
      (\forall x y z.\ x \leq y \logand y \leq z \implies x \leq z) \logand      \\
      (\forall x y.\ x \leq y \logand y \leq x \implies (x = y))
  \ea $$

A well-ordered set (woset) has the two additional properties of being total
and wellfounded:

$$ woset(\leq) =
 \ba (\forall x \in fl(\leq).\ x \leq x) \logand                               \\
     (\forall x y z.\ x \leq y \logand y \leq z \implies x \leq z) \logand       \\
     (\forall x y.\ x \leq y \logand y \leq x \implies (x = y)) \logand          \\
     (\forall x \in fl(\leq),\ y \in fl(\leq).\
           x \leq y \logor y \leq x)) \logand \\
     (\forall P \subseteq fl(\leq).\ (P \not= \emptyset) \implies
       \exists y \in fl(\leq).\ P y \logand \forall z \in P.\ y \leq z)
 \ea $$

We also define a chain in a poset as a set whose elements are all comparable
under the ordering, i.e.

$$ chain(\leq) C = \forall x \in C,\ y \in C.\ x \leq y \logor y \leq x $$

It would be more consistent to define a chain as a total order which is a
subset of $\leq$, but since we have little interest in the chain as an ordered
set, we use a subset of the field instead.

Next is the property of one relation being an initial segment of another. This
is defined as

$$ \leq' inseg \leq =
   \forall x y.\ x \leq' y = x \leq y \logand y \in fl(\leq') $$

A special form of initial segment is the set of all elements less than some
given element, thus:

$$ linseg(\leq) a = \{ (x,y) | x \leq y \logand y < a $$

Finally, it is convenient to have a function {\tt less} which converts a
reflexive partial order into an irreflexive one:

$$ less(\leq)(x,y) = x \leq y \wedge x \not= y $$

We define an {\em ordinal} to be a woset such that each element is chosen
canonically using the choice operator applied to the complement of its
predecessors (compare the von Neumann definition in set theory where each
element is actually its set of predecessors).

$$ ordinal(\leq) = woset(\leq) \logand
                   \forall x \in fl(\leq).\ x = \varepsilon y.\ y \not < x $$


\section{A Useful lemma}

Before embarking on the main proofs, we prove a few lemmas. One of these is
quite interesting and useful. The following theorem reduces from 5 to 2 the
number of properties we need to establish to show that a relation is a
wellorder. It states that a relation is a wellorder iff it is antisymmetric and
wellfounded (in the sense of every set having a {\em least}, not just minimal,
element).

$$ woset(\leq) =
 \ba (\forall x y.\ x \leq y \logand y \leq x \implies (x = y)) \logand     \\
     (\forall P \subseteq fl(\leq).\ (P \not= \emptyset) \implies
       \exists y \in fl(\leq).\ P y \logand \forall z \in P.\ y \leq z)
 \ea $$

{\em Proof:} Clearly it is sufficient to prove that a relation $\leq$ that is
antisymmetric and wellfounded is also total, reflexive and transitive. The
relation is total because for any $x$ and $y$ in its field, the set $\{x,y\}$
has a least member, so either $x \leq y$ or $y \leq x$. Reflexivity is a
special case of totality, where $x$ and $y$ are the same. Finally, if $\leq$ is
not transitive, then there exist $x$, $y$ and $z$ in the field such that

$$ x \leq y \logand y \leq z \logand x \not\leq z $$

By totality, $z \leq x$, so we have

$$ x \leq y \logand y \leq z \logand z \leq x $$

Clearly $\{x,y,z\} \subseteq fl(\leq)$, and so has a least element $w$. There
are now three essentially identical cases to consider, according as $w$ is $x$,
$y$ or $z$. It is easy to show that in each case we get $x = y = z$, so
$x \leq z$, which is a contradiction.

\section{The Recursion Theorem}

The Recursion theorem is proved in three stages:

\begin{itemize}

\item Any two functions which satisfy the recursion equation for some
downward-closed subset of the measure (i.e. for all arguments whose measures
are less than some value) agree on the common `domain'. This is an easy proof
by induction.

\item For any value, one can indeed define such a function which `locally'
satisfies the recursion equation. Again this can be proved by induction.

\item Now a global function exists. This can be defined as the `union' of all
the local functions, since by the first theorem, they all agree on any common
domain.

\end{itemize}

\section{Main theorems in the wellorder library}

We list here the four versions of the Axiom Of Choice, and sketch their proof.

\subsection{The Well-Ordering principle}

Every set can be wellordered, i.e.

$$ \forall P.\ \exists \leq.\ woset(\leq) \logand (fl(\leq) = P) $$

{\em Proof:} In fact the HOL proof first shows that the universal set of every
type can be wellordered. Then one can order a subset simply by the restriction
of the wellorder to that subset. This makes the proofs in HOL simpler, so in
the description that follows, $P$ is actually a universal set of some type.

The proof exploits the canonicality of ordinals. The crucial result is that for
any two ordinals, one is an initial segment of the other. We first prove two
theorems which are closely related to two basic properties of `real' ordinals:

\begin{itemize}

\item The union of any set of ordinals is an ordinal

\item Each ordinal which does not correspond to the type universe has a
`successor' which arises by adding on the canonically chosen element.

\end{itemize}

We also show that the union of initial segments of an order is again an initial
segment. All these proofs are quite easy by using the definitions directly.

Now suppose $\leq$ and $\leq'$ are two ordinals. Take the union of the set of
all ordinals which are initial segments of $\leq$ and $\leq'$. By the above
remarks, this is also an ordinal and hence the largest ordinal which is an
initial segment of both. We claim that in fact it must be either the whole of
$\leq$ or the whole of $\leq'$, because if not, we could form a successor.
Because of the canonicality property, this successor is also an initial segment
of both $\leq$ and $\leq'$, which yields a contradiction.

Now our wellordering is simply the union of all ordinals (of that type).
Because of the above property, this gives a welldefined ordinal, and it is easy
to see again that it must be the whole type or we could form its successor.

\subsection{Hausdorff's Maximal Principle}

Every poset has a maximal chain (under inclusion), i.e.

$$ \exists C.\ chain(\leq) C \logand
          \forall C'.\ chain(\leq) C' \logand C \subseteq C' \implies (C' = C) $$

{\em Proof:} The idea is to use transfinite recursion to produce a maximal
chain. If $fl(\leq)$ is empty we are finished (the empty set serves).
Otherwise, wellorder the whole of the type using the wellordering principle;
call this wellordering $\leq_w$, and let $\bot$ be the $\leq_w$-least element
of $fl(\leq)$. Now we can define a function over the whole type by recursion as
follows:

$$ f(x) = \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
        x & \mbox{if $x \in fl(\leq)$ and $\forall y.\ y <_w x \implies x \leq
f(y) \logor f(y) \leq x$}\\
     \bot & \mbox{otherwise}
                 \end{array} \right. $$

We claim that the image under $f$ of the whole type is a chain, i.e. that
$f(x)$ and $f(y)$ are $\leq$-comparable for any $x$ and $y$. Firstly it is easy
to see that $f(\bot) = \bot$, and by construction every $f(x)$ is
$\leq$-comparable with $\bot$. Furthermore each $f(x)$ is in $fl(\leq)$.
Now it is quite easy to see that the result holds. If $x = y$ then it is
immediate that $f(x) \leq f(y)$ as $\leq$ is reflexive on its field. Otherwise
suppose $y <_w x$ (the other case is similar). By construction either $f(x) =
\bot$, in which case we have already seen that comparability holds, or $f(x) =
x$ and we know that $x$ (and hence $f(x)$) is comparable to $f(y)$ since
$y <_w x$. Consequently the range of $f$ is a chain, and it is easy to see that
it must be a maximal one, because if $z$ is comparable to all members of the
chain, it is certainly comparable to those elements $<_w$-less than it. Hence
by construction it would have been added to the chain.
\subsection{Zorn's Lemma}

A poset in which each chain has an upper bound has a maximal element.

$$ \ba (\forall C.\ chain(\leq) C \implies \exists m \in fl(\leq).\
            \forall x \in C.\ x \leq m) \\
     \implies
       \exists m \in fl(\leq).\
            \forall x \in fl(\leq).\ m \leq x \implies (m = x)
   \ea $$

{\em Proof:} Suppose $\leq$ is a poset with the property that every chain has an
upper bound. By Hausdorff's Maximal Principle, we can find a maximal chain $C$,
and by hypothesis, we can find an upper bound for it, say $m$.

We claim that $m$ is a maximal element. For suppose there is an $x \in fl(\leq)$ with
$m \leq x$. Evidently $C \union \{x\}$ is then a chain, but since $C$ is a
{\em maximal} chain, we must have $C \union \{x\} = C$, in other words
$x \in C $. But since $m$ is an upper bound for $C$, we have $x \leq m$. Now by
antisymmetry of $\leq$, we have $m = x$ as required.

\subsection{Kuratowski's Lemma}

Every chain in a poset is contained in a maximal chain (under inclusion), i.e.

$$ \forall C.\ chain(\leq) C \implies
     \exists C'.\ \ba (chain(\leq) C' \logand C \subseteq C') \logand \\
                      \forall C''.\ (chain(\leq) C'' \logand C' \subseteq C'')
                                \implies (C'' = C')
          \ea $$

{\em Proof:} This could have been proved by a slight elaboration of the proof
of the Hausdorff Maximal Principle, or by applying that principle to the
partial order of elements not in, but comparable to all elements of, the chain.
However the simplest seems to be a direct application of Zorn's lemma. Simply
order the set of chains extending $C$. Zorn's Lemma assures us of a
$\subseteq$-maximal chain extending $C$, provided we can show that a chain $P$
of chains extending $C$ has another such chain as its upper bound. But this is
easy: if $P$ is empty then take $C$, otherwise take the union of $P$.

@\DOC GENL

\TYPE {GENL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes zero or more variables in the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term list {[x1;...;xn]} and a theorem {A |- t}, the inference
rule {GENL} returns the theorem {A |- !x1...xn. t}, provided none of the
variables {xi} are free in any of the assumptions. It is not necessary that
any or all of the {xi} should be free in {t}.
{
         A |- t
   ------------------  GENL "[x1;...;xn]"       [where no xi is free in A]
    A |- !x1...xn. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless all the terms in the list are variables, none of which are
free in the assumption list.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC RESQ_RES_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_RES_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Enriches assumptions by repeatedly resolving restricted universal
quantifications in them against the others.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, resolution, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
{RESQ_RES_TAC} uses those assumptions which are restricted universal
quantifications in resolution in a way similar to {RES_TAC}. It calls
{RESQ_RES_THEN} repeatedly until there is no more resolution can be done.
The conclusions of all the new results are returned as additional
assumptions of the subgoal(s).  The effect of {RESQ_RES_TAC} 
on a goal is to enrich the assumption set with some of its collective
consequences.


\FAILURE
{RESQ_RES_TAC} cannot fail and so should not be unconditionally {REPEAT}ed.

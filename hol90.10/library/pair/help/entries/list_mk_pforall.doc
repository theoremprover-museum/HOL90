\DOC list_mk_pforall

\TYPE {list_mk_pforall : ((term list # term) -> term)}

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively constructs a paired universal quantification.

\DESCRIBE
{list_mk_pforall(["p1";...;"pn"],"t")} returns {"!p1 ... pn. t"}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {list_mk_pforall} if the terms in the list are not paired structures
of variables or if {t} is not of type {":bool"} and the list of terms is 
nonempty.
If the list of terms is empty the type of {t} can be anything.

\COMMENTS
The system shows the type as {(goal -> term)}.

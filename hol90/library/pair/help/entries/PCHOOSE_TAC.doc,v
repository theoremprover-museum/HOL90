@\DOC PCHOOSE_TAC

\TYPE {PCHOOSE_TAC : thm_tactic}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, existential.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Adds the body of a paired existentially quantified theorem to the assumptions
of a goal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A' |- ?p. t} and a goal, {CHOOSE_TAC} adds
{t[p'/p]} to the assumptions of the goal, where {p'} is a variant of 
the pair {p} which has no components free in the assumption list;
normally {p'} is just {p}.
{
         A ?- u
   ====================  CHOOSE_TAC (A' |- ?q. t)
    A u {{t[p'/p]}} ?- u
}
\noindent Unless {A'} is a subset of {A}, this is not a valid tactic.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theorem is a paired existential quantification.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

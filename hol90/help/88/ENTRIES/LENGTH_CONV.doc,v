@\DOC LENGTH_CONV

\TYPE {LENGTH_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the length of an object-language list.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, list.

\DESCRIBE
For any object language list of the form {"[x1;x2;...;xn]"}, where {x1},
{x2}, ..., {xn} are arbitrary terms of the same type, the result of evaluating
{
   LENGTH_CONV "LENGTH [x1;x2;...;xn]"
}
\noindent is the theorem
{
   |- LENGTH [x1;x2;...;xn] = n
}
\noindent where {n} is the numeral constant that denotes the length of the
list.

\FAILURE
{LENGTH_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form {"LENGTH [x1;x2;...;xn]"} or
{"LENGTH []"}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

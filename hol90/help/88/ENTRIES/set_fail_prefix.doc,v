@\DOC set_fail_prefix

\TYPE {set_fail_prefix : (string -> (* -> **) -> * -> **)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specifies a prefix to the failure string for a function evaluation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a string {s} and a function {f}, the function {set_fail_prefix}
gives a function which behaves identically to {f} except that on failure, the
failure string given by {f} has {s} and {`--`} prepended.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#BETA_CONV "1 + 1";;
evaluation failed     BETA_CONV

#(set_fail_prefix `Application to "1 + 1" ` BETA_CONV) "1 + 1";;
evaluation failed     Application to "1 + 1"  -- BETA_CONV
}
\USES
Providing a traceback of failures through function applications.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {RIGHT_IMP_PEXISTS_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, implication.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired existential quantification of the consequent outwards through
an implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {t ==> (?p. u)}, 
{RIGHT_IMP_PEXISTS_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- t ==> (?p. u) = (?p'. t ==> (u[p'/p]))
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of the pair {p} that does not
contain any variables that appear free in the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {t ==> (?p. u)}.

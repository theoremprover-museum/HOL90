\DOC ANTE_CONJ_CONV

\TYPE {ANTE_CONJ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates a conjunctive antecedent in favour of implication.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conjunction, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(t1 /\ t2) ==> t}, the conversion
{ANTE_CONJ_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (t1 /\ t2 ==> t) = (t1 ==> t2 ==> t)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {"(t1 /\ t2) ==> t"}.

\USES
Somewhat ad-hoc, but can be used (with {CONV_TAC}) to transform a goal of the
form {?- (P /\ Q) ==> R} into the subgoal {?- P ==> (Q ==> R)}, so that only
the antecedent {P} is moved into the assumptions by {DISCH_TAC}.

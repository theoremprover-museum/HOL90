\TYPE {is_presburger : (term -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Determines whether a formula is in the Presburger subset of arithmetic.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
This function returns true if the argument term is a formula in the Presburger
subset of natural number arithmetic. Presburger natural arithmetic is the
subset of arithmetic formulae made up from natural number constants, numeric
variables, addition, multiplication by a constant, the natural number
relations {<}, {<=}, {=}, {>=}, {>} and the logical connectives {~}, {/\},
{\/}, {==>}, {=} (if-and-only-if), {!} (`forall') and {?} (`there exists').

Products of two expressions which both contain variables are not included in
the subset, but the function {SUC} which is not normally included in a
specification of Presburger arithmetic is allowed in this HOL implementation.
This function also considers subtraction to be part of the subset.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#is_presburger "!m n p. m < (2 * n) /\ (n + n) <= p ==> m < SUC p";;
true : bool

#is_presburger "!m n p q. m < (n * p) /\ (n * p) < q ==> m < q";;
false : bool

#is_presburger "(m <= n) ==> !p. (m < SUC(n + p))";;
true : bool

#is_presburger "(m + n) - m = n";;
true : bool
}
\USES
Useful for determining whether a decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic
is applicable to a term.

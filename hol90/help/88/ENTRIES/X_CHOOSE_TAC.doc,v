@\DOC X_CHOOSE_TAC

\TYPE {X_CHOOSE_TAC : (term -> thm_tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Assumes a theorem, with existentially quantified variable replaced by a given
witness.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, witness, quantifier, existential.

\DESCRIBE
{X_CHOOSE_TAC} expects a variable {y} and theorem with an existentially
quantified conclusion.  When applied to a goal, it adds a new
assumption obtained by introducing the variable {y} as a witness for
the object {x} whose existence is asserted in the theorem.
{
           A ?- t
   ===================  X_CHOOSE_TAC "y" (A1 |- ?x. w)
    A u {{w[y/x]}} ?- t         ("y" not free anywhere)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not existentially quantified, or if
the first argument is not a variable.  Failures may arise in the
tactic-generating function.  An invalid tactic is produced if the
introduced variable is free in {w} or {t}, or if the theorem has any
hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an assumption of the
goal.

\EXAMPLE
Given a goal of the form
{
   {{n < m}} ?- ?x. m = n + (x + 1)
}
\noindent the following theorem may be applied:
{
   th = ["n < m"] |- ?p. m = n + p
}
\noindent by the tactic {(X_CHOOSE_TAC "q:num" th)} giving
the subgoal:
{
   {{n < m, m = n + q}} ?- ?x. m = n + (x + 1)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

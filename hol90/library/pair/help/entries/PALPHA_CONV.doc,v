@\DOC PALPHA_CONV

\TYPE {PALPHA_CONV : (term -> conv)}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, alpha.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Renames the bound variables of a paired lambda-abstraction.

\DESCRIBE
If {"q"} is a variable of type {ty} and {"\p.t"} is a paired abstraction in
which the bound pair {p} also has type {ty}, then {ALPHA_CONV "q" "\p.t"}
returns the theorem:
{
   |- (\p.t) = (\q'. t[q'/p])
}
\noindent where the pair {q':ty} is a primed variant of {q} chosen so
that none of its components are free in {"\p.t"}.
The pairs {p} and {q} need not have the same structure, but they must
be of the same type.

\EXAMPLE
{PALPHA_CONV} renames the variables in a bound pair:
{
   #PALPHA_CONV
     "((w:*,x:*),(y:*,z:*))"
     "\((a:*,b:*),(c:*,d:*)). (f a b c d):*";;
   |- (\((a,b),c,d). f a b c d) = (\((w,x),y,z). f w x y z)
}
The new bound pair and the old bound pair need not have the same structure.
{
   #PALPHA_CONV
     "((wx:*#*),(y:*,z:*))"
     "\((a:*,b:*),(c:*,d:*)). (f a b c d):*";;
   |- (\((a,b),c,d). f a b c d) = (\(wx,y,z). f(FST wx)(SND wx)y z)
}
{PALPHA_CONV} recognises subpairs of a pair as variables and preserves
structure accordingly.
{
   #PALPHA_CONV
     "((wx:*#*),(y:*,z:*))"
     "\((a:*,b:*),(c:*,d:*)). (f (a,b) c d):*";;
   |- (\((a,b),c,d). f(a,b)c d) = (\(wx,y,z). f wx y z)
}

\COMMENTS
{PALPHA_CONV} will only ever add the terms {"FST"} and {"SND"}.
(i.e. it will never remove them).
This means that while {"\(x,y). x + y"} can be converted to
{"\xy. (FST xy) + (SND xy)"}, it can not be converted back again.

\FAILURE
{PALPHA_CONV "q" "tm"} fails if {q} is not a variable,
if {tm} is not an abstraction,
or if {q} is a variable and {tm} is the lambda abstraction
{\p.t} but the types of {p} and {q} differ.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

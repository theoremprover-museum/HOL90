\TYPE {non_presburger_subterms : (term -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the subterms of a term that are not in the Presburger subset of
arithmetic.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
This function computes a list of subterms of a term that are not in the
Presburger subset of natural number arithmetic. All numeric variables in the
term are included in the result. Presburger natural arithmetic is the subset
of arithmetic formulae made up from natural number constants, numeric
variables, addition, multiplication by a constant, the natural number
relations {<}, {<=}, {=}, {>=}, {>} and the logical connectives {~}, {/\},
{\/}, {==>}, {=} (if-and-only-if), {!} (`forall') and {?} (`there exists').

Products of two expressions which both contain variables are not included in
the subset, so such products will appear in the result list. However, the
function {SUC} which is not normally included in a specification of Presburger
arithmetic is allowed in this HOL implementation. This function also considers
subtraction to be part of the subset.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#non_presburger_subterms "!m n p. m < (2 * n) /\ (n + n) <= p ==> m < SUC p";;
["m"; "n"; "p"] : term list

#non_presburger_subterms "!m n p q. m < (n * p) /\ (n * p) < q ==> m < q";;
["m"; "n * p"; "q"] : term list

#non_presburger_subterms "(m + n) - m = f n";;
["m"; "n"; "f n"] : term list
}

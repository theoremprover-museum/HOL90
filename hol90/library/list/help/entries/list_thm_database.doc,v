@\DOC list_thm_database

\TYPE {list_thm_database: unit -> {{Aux_thms: thm list, Fold_thms: thm list}}}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the theorems known by {LIST_CONV}.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {LIST_CONV} uses a database of theorems relating to system list
constants. These theorems fall into two categories: definitions of list
operators in terms of {FOLDR} and {FOLDL}; and auxiliary theorems about the
base element and step functions in those definitions. {list_thm_database} provides a means of inspecting the database.

A call to {list_thm_database()} returns a pair of lists. The first element of
the pair contains the known fold definitions. The second contains the known
auxiliary theorems.

The  following is an example of a fold definition in the database:  
{
   |- !l. SUM l = FOLDR $+ 0 l
}
\noindent Here {$+} is the step function and 0 is the base element of the
definition. Definitions are initially held for the following system operators:
{APPEND}, {FLAT}, {LENGTH}, {NULL}, {REVERSE}, {MAP}, {FILTER}, {ALL_EL},
{SUM}, {SOME_EL}, {IS_EL}, {AND_EL}, {OR_EL}, {PREFIX}, {SUFFIX}, {SNOC} and
{FLAT} combined with {REVERSE}.

The following is an example of an auxiliary theorem:
{
   |- MONOID $+ 0
}
\noindent Auxiliary theorems stored include monoid, commutativity,
associativity, binary function commutativity, left identity and right identity
theorems.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

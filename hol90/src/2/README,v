This directory contains extensions to HOL built on top of
the HOL core, but which are included in the standard HOL
release.  Here the "core" includes everything up to
BASIC_HOL, i.e. booleans, pairs and natural numbers.

Major procedures are contained in the subdirectories:
	Satisfy - Existential Satisfaction via Unification
	Simplifier - Conditional, Contextual Rewriter with integrated
		decision procedures
	Tableux - First order proof procedure courtesy of JRH.

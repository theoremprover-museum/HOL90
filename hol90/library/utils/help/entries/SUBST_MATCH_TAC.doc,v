@\DOC SUBST_MATCH_TAC

\TYPE
{
SUBST_MATCH_TAC :thm_tactic
}

\LIBRARY utils

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal with an instance of a single theorem, where the instance
may be derived by instantiating variables that occur in the hypothesis of
the given theorem.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {SUBST_MATCH_TAC thm} strips the theorem {thm} to find an
equation {lhs = rhs} then looks for a match between {lhs} and the
subterms of the goal.  Once a match is found the theorem is
instantiated to the particular instance found, and {NEW_SUBST1_TAC}
is used to write the goal with the result.


\FAILURE
The tactic {SUBST_MATCH_TAC thm} will fail if either {thm} does not
strip to and equation, or if no match is found with the left hand side
of the equation.



\EXAMPLE
The tactic
{
   SUBST_MATCH_TAC (SYM (UNDISCH SBGP_ID_GP_ID))
}
where 
{
   SBGP_ID_GP_ID = |- SUBGROUP(G,prod)H ==> (ID(H,prod) = ID(G,prod))
}
when applied to the goal
{
   ([(--`SUBGROUP((\N. T),$plus)H`--)],(--`H(ID((\N. T),$plus))`--))
}
returns the subgoal
{
   ([(--`SUBGROUP((\N. T),$plus)H`--)],(--`H(ID(H,$plus))`--))
}


\USES
Rewriting with a theorem that has hypotheses that need to be
instantiated by the matching of the rewriting.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC END_STACK_TAC

\TYPE {END_STACK_TAC : (unit -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Closes a subwindow opened on the current goal of the subgoals package.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{END_STACK_TAC} name closes all the subwindows on the window stack
called {"TACTIC STACK"} and returns to the parent window of the stack.
The theorem in this window is used to generate a theorem of the form
{(H |- goal' ==> goal)} where {goal} is the current goal of the
subgoal package.  The current goal is transformed from {goal} to
{goal'} and the stack named {"TACTIC STACK"} is ended.

\FAILURE
{END_STACK_TAC} will fail if you have done any other tactical
reasoning since opening the window with {BEGIN_STACK_TAC}.
{END_STACK_TAC} will also fail if there are any used conjectures in
the current window.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

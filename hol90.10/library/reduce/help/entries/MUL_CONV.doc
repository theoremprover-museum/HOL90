\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{MUL_CONV "m * n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m * n = s
}
\noindent where {s} is the numeral that denotes the product of the natural
numbers denoted by {m} and {n}.

\FAILURE
{MUL_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m * n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#MUL_CONV "0 * 12";;
|- 0 * 12 = 0

#MUL_CONV "1 * 1";;
|- 1 * 1 = 1

#MUL_CONV "6 * 11";;
|- 6 * 11 = 66
}

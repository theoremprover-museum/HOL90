\DOC bool_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {bool_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies expressions involving boolean equality.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {bool_EQ_CONV} simplifies equations of the form {t1 = t2},
where {t1} and {t2} are of type {bool}.  When applied to a term of the form
{t = t}, the conversion {bool_EQ_CONV} returns the theorem
{
   |- (t = t) = T
}
\noindent When applied to a term of the form {t = T}, the conversion returns
{
   |- (t = T) = t
}
\noindent And when applied to a term of the form {T = t}, it returns
{
   |- (T = t) = t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless applied to a term of the form {t1 = t2}, where {t1} and {t2} are
boolean, and either {t1} and {t2} are syntactically identical terms or one of
{t1} and {t2} is the constant {T}.

\EXAMPLE
{
    - bool_EQ_CONV (Parse.term_parser `T = F`);
    val it = |- (T = F) = F : thm

    - bool_EQ_CONV (Parse.term_parser `(0 < n) = T`);
    val it = |- (0 < n = T) = 0 < n : thm
}

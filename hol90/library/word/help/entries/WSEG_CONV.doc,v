@\DOC WSEG_CONV

\TYPE {WSEG_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, word.

\LIBRARY word

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the result of taking a segment from a word.

\DESCRIBE
For any word of the form {WORD[b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0]}, the result of evaluating
{
   WSEG_CONV "WSEG m k (WORD [b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0])",
}
\noindent where {m} and {k} must be numeric constants, is the theorem
{
   |- WSEG m k (WORD [b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0]) = [b(m+k-1);...;bk]
}
\noindent The bits are indexed form the end of the list and starts
from 0.

\FAILURE
{WSEG_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above,
or {m + k} is not less than the size of the word.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

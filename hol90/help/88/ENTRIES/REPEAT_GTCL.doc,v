@\DOC REPEAT_GTCL

\TYPE {REPEAT_GTCL : (thm_tactical -> thm_tactical)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a theorem-tactical until it fails when applied to a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactical, a theorem-tactic, a theorem and a goal:
{
   REPEAT_GTCL ttl ttac th goal
}
\noindent {REPEAT_GTCL} repeatedly modifies the theorem according to
{ttl} till the result of handing it to {ttac} and applying it to the goal
fails (this may be no times at all).

\FAILURE
Fails iff the theorem-tactic fails immediately when applied to the theorem
and the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The following tactic matches {th}'s antecedents against the assumptions
of the goal until it can do so no longer, then puts the resolvents
onto the assumption list:
{
   REPEAT_GTCL (IMP_RES_THEN ASSUME_TAC) th
}
\SEEALSO
REPEAT_TCL, THEN_TCL.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

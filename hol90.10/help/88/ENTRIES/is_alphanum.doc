\TYPE {is_alphanum : (string -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests whether a character is alphanumeric.

\DESCRIBE
When given a string, which should be of length 1, {is_alphanum} returns
{true} iff the character is alphanumeric. By default this means that it
is an upper or lower case letter, a digit, a prime ({'}) or an
underscore ({_}). However the definition can be changed using the function
{new_alphanum}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the string has length greater than 1. Returns {false} for the
null string ({``}).

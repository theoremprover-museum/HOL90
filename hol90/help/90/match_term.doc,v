\TYPE {match_term : term -> term -> (term subst * hol_type subst)}

\SYNOPSIS
Finds instantiations to match one term to another.

\DESCRIBE

When applied to two terms, {match_term} attempts to find a set of type
and term instantiations for the first term (only) to make it
alpha-convertible to the second. If it succeeds, it returns the
instantiations in the form of a pair containing a term substitution and
a type substitution. If the first term represents the conclusion of a
theorem, the returned instantiations are of the appropriate form to be
passed to {INST_TY_TERM}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term cannot be matched by one-way instantiation.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how {match_term} could be used to match the conclusion of a
theorem to a term.
{
   - val th = REFL (--`x:'a`--);
   th = |- x = x

   - match_term (concl th) (--`1 = 1`--);
   val it = ([{{redex = (--`x`--), residue = (--`1`--)}}],
             [{{redex = (==`:'a`==), residue= (==`:num`==)}}])
     : term subst * hol_type subst

  - INST_TY_TERM it th;
   |- 1 = 1
}
\COMMENTS
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned instantiations will be
possible for {INST_TY_TERM} to achieve, because some of the variables (term or
type) which need to be instantiated may be free in the assumptions, eg:
{
   - (show_types := true; show_assums := true);
   () : unit

   - val th = ASSUME (--`x:'a = x`--);
   val th = [(x :'a) = (x :'a)] |- (x :'a) = (x :'a) : thm

   - match_term (concl th) (--`1 = 1`--);
   val it = ([{{redex = (--`x :num`--), residue = (--`1`--)}}],
             [{{redex = (==`:'a`==), residue = (==`:num`==)}}])
     : term subst * hol_type subst

   - INST_TY_TERM it th handle e => Raise e;
   Exception raised at Thm.INST_TYPE:
   type variable(s) in assumptions would be instantiated in concl

}
\noindent In fact, for instantiating a theorem, {PART_MATCH} is usually easier.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC CONV_TAC

\TYPE {CONV_TAC : (conv -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a tactic from a conversion.

\KEYWORDS
conversional, tactical.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion, then {CONV_TAC c} is a tactic that applies {c} to the
goal.  That is, if {c} maps a term {"g"} to the theorem {|- g = g'}, then the
tactic {CONV_TAC c} reduces a goal {g} to the subgoal {g'}.  More precisely, if
{c "g"} returns {A' |- g = g'}, then:
{
         A ?- g
     ===============  CONV_TAC c
         A ?- g'
}
\noindent Note that the conversion {c} should return a theorem whose
assumptions are also among the assumptions of the goal (normally, the
conversion will returns a theorem with no assumptions). {CONV_TAC} does not
fail if this is not the case, but the resulting tactic will be invalid, so the
theorem ultimately proved using this tactic will have more assumptions than
those of the original goal.

\FAILURE
{CONV_TAC c} applied to a goal {A ?- g} fails if {c} fails when applied to the
term {g}. The function returned by {CONV_TAC c} will also fail if the ML
function {c:term->thm} is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps
a term {t} to a theorem {|- t = t'}).

\USES
{CONV_TAC} is used to apply simplifications that can't be expressed as
equations (rewrite rules).  For example, a goal can be simplified by
beta-reduction, which is not expressible as a single equation, using the tactic
{
   CONV_TAC(DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)
}
\noindent The conversion {BETA_CONV} maps a beta-redex {"(\x.u)v"} to the
theorem
{
   |- (\x.u)v = u[v/x]
}
\noindent and the ML expression {(DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)} evaluates to a
conversion that maps a term {"t"} to the theorem {|- t=t'} where {t'} is
obtained from {t} by beta-reducing all beta-redexes in {t}. Thus
{CONV_TAC(DEPTH_CONV BETA_CONV)} is a tactic which reduces beta-redexes
anywhere in a goal.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

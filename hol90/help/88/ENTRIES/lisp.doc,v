@\DOC lisp

\TYPE {lisp : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Executes a lisp command from ML.

\DESCRIBE
{lisp} executes a lisp s-expression (written as an ML string).  Returned
values do not appear on the standard output, unless they are explicitly
printed.

\FAILURE
Fails if the s-expression is improperly constructed or fails when
evaluated by lisp.

\EXAMPLE
{
#lisp `(princ "hello")`;;
hello() : void

#lisp `(cons 'a 'b)`;;
() : void

#lisp `(princ (cons 'a 'b))`;;
(A . B)() : void

#lisp `(car 'a)`;;
Error: Attempt to take the car of A which is not a cons.
evaluation failed     lisp -- NIL

#lisp `(princ "hello"`;;
Error: eof encountered on input stream #<string input stream  @@ #x869fe6>
evaluation failed     lisp -- NIL
}
\COMMENTS
{lisp} is not meant for general use, and should be treated with great
care.  If one is not wary, it is entirely possible to corrupt HOL by
using it.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

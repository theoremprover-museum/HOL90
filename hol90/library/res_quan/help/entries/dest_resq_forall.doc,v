@\DOC dest_resq_forall

\TYPE {dest_resq_forall : (term -> (term # term # term))}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart a restricted universally quantified term into
the quantified variable, predicate and body.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_resq_forall} is a term destructor for restricted universal
quantification: 
{
   dest_resq_forall "!var::P. t"
}
\noindent returns {("var","P","t")}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {dest_resq_forall} if the term is not a restricted
universal quantification.

\SEEALSO
mk_resq_forall, is_resq_forall, strip_resq_forall.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

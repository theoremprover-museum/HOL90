1.2
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

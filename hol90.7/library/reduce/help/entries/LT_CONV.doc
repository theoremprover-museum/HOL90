\SYNOPSIS

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are both numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{LT_CONV "m < n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (m < n) = T
}
\noindent if the natural number denoted by {m} is less than that denoted by
{n}, or
{
   |- (m < n) = F
}
\noindent otherwise.

\FAILURE
{LT_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form {"m < n"}, where {m} and {n}
are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#LT_CONV "0 < 12";;
|- 0 < 12 = T

#LT_CONV "13 < 13";;
|- 13 < 13 = F

#LT_CONV "25 < 12";;
|- 25 < 12 = F
}

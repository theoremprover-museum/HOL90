\DOC bool_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {bool_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies expressions involving boolean equality.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {bool_EQ_CONV} simplifies equations of the form {"t1 = t2"},
where {t1} and {t2} are of type {:bool}.  When applied to a term of the form
{"t = t"}, the conversion {bool_EQ_CONV} returns the theorem
{
   |- (t = t) = T
}
\noindent When applied to a term of the form {"t = T"}, the conversion returns
{
   |- (t = T) = t
}
\noindent And when applied to a term of the form {"T = t"}, it returns
{
   |- (T = t) = t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless applied to a term of the form {"t1 = t2"}, where {t1} and {t2} are
boolean, and either {t1} and {t2} are syntactically identical terms or one of
{t1} and {t2} is the constant {"T"}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#bool_EQ_CONV "T = F";;
|- (T = F) = F

#bool_EQ_CONV "(0 < n) = T";;
|- (0 < n = T) = 0 < n
}

\TYPE {theorems : (string -> (string # thm) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the derived theorems of a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call of {theorems `thy`} returns the derived theorems of the theory segment
{thy} together with their names. The theory segment {thy} must be part of
the current theory. The names are those given to the theorems by the user when
they were originally added to the theory segment (by, for example, a call to
{save_thm}). The name of the current theory segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {theorems `thy`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not part
of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#theorems `bool`;;
[(`PAIR_EQ`, |- !x y a b. (x,y = a,b) = (x = a) /\ (y = b));
 (`SND`, |- !x y. SND(x,y) = y);
 (`FST`, |- !x y. FST(x,y) = x);
 (`PAIR`, |- !x. FST x,SND x = x);
 (`PAIR_EXISTS`, |- ?p. IS_PAIR p)]
: (string # thm) list

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC MK_PAIR

\TYPE {MK_PAIR : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of pairs constructed from equal components.

\KEYWORDS
rule, pair, equality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- a = x} and {A2 |- b = y}, the inference
rule {MK_PAIR} returns the theorem {A1 u A2 |- (a,b) = (x,y)}.
{
    A1 |- a = x   A2 |- b = y
   ---------------------------  MK_PAIR
    A1 u A2 |- (a,b) = (x,y)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless both theorems are equational.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

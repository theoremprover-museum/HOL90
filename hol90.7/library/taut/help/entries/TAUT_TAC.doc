\DESCRIBE
Given a goal that is an instance of a propositional formula, this tactic will
prove the goal provided it is valid. A propositional formula is a term
containing only Boolean constants, Boolean-valued variables, Boolean
equalities, implications, conjunctions, disjunctions, negations and
Boolean-valued conditionals. An instance of a formula is the formula with one
or more of the variables replaced by terms of the same type. The tactic
accepts goals with or without universal quantifiers for the variables.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the goal is not an instance of a propositional
formula or if the instance is not a valid formula.

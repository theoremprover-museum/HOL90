\DOC DISCARD_TAC

\TYPE {DISCARD_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Discards a theorem already present in a goal's assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A' |- s} and a goal, {DISCARD_TAC}
checks that {s} is simply {T} (true), or already exists (up
to alpha-conversion) in the assumption list of the goal. In
either case, the tactic has no effect. Otherwise, it fails.
{
    A ?- t
   ========  DISCARD_TAC (A' |- s)
    A ?- t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the above conditions are not met, i.e. the theorem's conclusion
is not {T} or already in the assumption list (up to alpha-conversion).

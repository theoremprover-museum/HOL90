\TYPE {prove_induction_thm : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Derives structural induction for an automatically-defined concrete type.

\DESCRIBE
{prove_induction_thm} takes as its argument a primitive recursion theorem, in
the form returned by {define_type} for an automatically-defined concrete type.
When applied to such a theorem, {prove_induction_thm} automatically proves and
returns a theorem that states a structural induction principle for the concrete
type described by the argument theorem. The theorem returned by
{prove_induction_thm} is in a form suitable for use with the general structural
induction tactic {INDUCT_THEN}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument is not a theorem of the form returned by {define_type}.

\EXAMPLE
Given the following primitive recursion theorem for labelled binary trees:
{
   |- !f0 f1.
        ?! fn.
        (!x. fn(LEAF x) = f0 x) /\
        (!b1 b2. fn(NODE b1 b2) = f1(fn b1)(fn b2)b1 b2)
}
\noindent {prove_induction_thm} proves and returns the theorem:
{
   |- !P. (!x. P(LEAF x)) /\ (!b1 b2. P b1 /\ P b2 ==> P(NODE b1 b2)) ==>
          (!b. P b)
}
\noindent This theorem states the principle of structural induction on labelled
binary trees: if a predicate {P} is true of all leaf nodes, and if whenever it
is true of two subtrees {b1} and {b2} it is also true of the tree {NODE b1 b2},
then {P} is true of all labelled binary trees.

\TYPE {load_library : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Load a library.

\DESCRIBE
The function {load_library} can either be used to load an entire library or to
load only a part of a library. Loading an entire library called `{name}' is
done by evaluating 
{
   load_library `name`;;
}
\noindent This will attempt to load the library called {name} unless it is
already loaded, in which case a message is printed. The loading of a library
{name} is done by searching for the library's load file `{name/name.ml}' using
the internal library search path and then loading this file.  For example, if
the library search path contains the pathnames to a local library and to the
system library:
{
   [`~/lib/`; `/usr/lib/hol/Library/`]
}
\noindent then {load_library} will load the ML file
{
   ~/lib/name/name.ml
} 
\noindent if this exists in the local library.  Otherwise, the file
{
   /usr/lib/hol/Library/name/name.ml
}
\noindent will be loaded from the system library.

A named part of a library is loaded by evaluating:
{
   load_library `name:partname`;;
}
\noindent where {name} is the name of the library, and {partname} is the name
of a segment of this library.  In this case, {load_library} searches along the
library search path for the load file {name/partname.ml}.  Note that this can
be used to load an arbitrary ML file from the library. Users should not,
however, rely on this feature, but should access libraries only in the ways the
officially supported and documented in library manuals.

The results of evaluation during the loading of a library are displayed if the
flag {print_lib} is {true}.  Otherwise, the results of evaluation are not
printed but abbreviated by a series of dots, each of which represents the
evaluation of one ML phrase.

\FAILURE
Fails if the library load file cannot be found or if the ML code being loaded
itself fails for any reason.

\COMMENTS
More detail about the organization of libraries, in particular how to create
your own, can be found in DESCRIPTION, which also gives a list of all the
libraries currently in the standard HOL distribution.

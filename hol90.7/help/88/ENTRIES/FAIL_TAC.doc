\DOC FAIL_TAC

\TYPE {FAIL_TAC : (string -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tactic which always fails, with the supplied string.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
Whatever goal it is applied to, {FAIL_TAC s} always fails
with the string {s}.

\FAILURE
The application of {FAIL_TAC} to a string never fails; the resulting
tactic always fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following example uses the fact that if a tactic {t1} solves
a goal, then the tactic {t1 THEN t2} never results in the application
of {t2} to anything, because {t1} produces no subgoals. In attempting
to solve the following goal:
{
   ?- x => T | T
}
\noindent the tactic
{
   REWRITE_TAC[] THEN FAIL_TAC `Simple rewriting failed to solve goal`
}
\noindent will fail with the message provided, whereas:
{
   CONV_TAC COND_CONV THEN FAIL_TAC `Using COND_CONV failed to solve goal`
}
\noindent will silently solve the goal because {COND_CONV} reduces it to
just {?- T}.

\SEEALSO
ALL_TAC, NO_TAC.

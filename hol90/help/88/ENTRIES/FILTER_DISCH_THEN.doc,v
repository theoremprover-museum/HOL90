@\DOC FILTER_DISCH_THEN

\TYPE {FILTER_DISCH_THEN : (thm_tactic -> term -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Conditionally gives to a theorem-tactic the antecedent of an implicative goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, undischarge, antecedent, selective.

\DESCRIBE
If {FILTER_DISCH_THEN}'s second argument, a term, does not occur in the
antecedent, then {FILTER_DISCH_THEN} removes the antecedent and then creates a
theorem by {ASSUME}ing it. This new theorem is passed to {FILTER_DISCH_THEN}'s
first argument, which is subsequently expanded. For example, if
{
    A ?- t
   ========  f (ASSUME "u")
    B ?- v
}
\noindent then
{
    A ?- u ==> t
   ==============  FILTER_DISCH_THEN f
       B ?- v
}
\noindent Note that {FILTER_DISCH_THEN} treats {"~u"} as {"u ==> F"}.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_DISCH_THEN} will fail if a term which is identical, or alpha-equivalent
to {"w"} occurs free in the antecedent. {FILTER_DISCH_THEN} will also fail if
the theorem is an implication or a negation.

\COMMENTS
{FILTER_DISCH_THEN} is most easily understood by first understanding
{DISCH_THEN}.

\USES
For preprocessing an antecedent before moving it to the assumptions, or for
using antecedents and then throwing them away.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

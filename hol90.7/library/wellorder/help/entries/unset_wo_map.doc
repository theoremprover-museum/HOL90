\DOC unset_wo_map

\TYPE {unset_wo_map : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes interface map for constants in the ``wellorder'' library.

\LIBRARY wellorder

\DESCRIBE
To increase flexibility, the constants used in the wellorder library are
declared with a {wo_} prefix. The {unset_wo_map} function cancels the effect of
{set_wo_map}, which sets up an interface map to eliminate them from view. Any
existing interface map is preserved when the wellorder-related entries are
eliminated. The constants which have their prefixes hidden are: {subset},
{Union}, {fl}, {poset}, {chain}, {woset} and {inseg}.

\FAILURE
Fails only if some entries in the interface map matching the above have been
set by other means, so if subtracted, a constant would be hidden.

\COMMENTS
The interface map is not set up by default when the library is loaded.

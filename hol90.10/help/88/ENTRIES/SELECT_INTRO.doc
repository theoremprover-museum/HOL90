\DOC SELECT_INTRO

\TYPE {SELECT_INTRO : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces an epsilon term.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\DESCRIBE
{SELECT_INTRO} takes a theorem with an applicative conclusion, say
{P x}, and returns a theorem with the epsilon term {$@ P} in place
of the original operand {x}.
{
     A |- P x
   --------------  SELECT_INTRO
    A |- P($@ P)
}
\noindent The returned theorem asserts that {$@ P} denotes some value
at which {P} holds.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an application.

\EXAMPLE
Given the theorem
{
   th1 = |- (\n. m = n)m
}
\noindent applying {SELECT_INTRO} replaces the second occurrence of {m} with the
epsilon abstraction of the operator:
{
   #let th2 = SELECT_INTRO th1;;
   th2 = |- (\n. m = n)(@n. m = n)
}
\noindent This theorem could now be used to derive a further result:
{
   #EQ_MP(BETA_CONV(concl th2))th2;;
   |- m = (@n. m = n)
}

\DOC RESQ_RES_THEN

\TYPE {RESQ_RES_THEN : thm_tactic -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Resolves all restricted universally quantified assumptions against
other assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, resolution, restricted quantification.

\DESCRIBE
Like the function {RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN}, the function {RESQ_RES_THEN}
performs a single step resolution. The difference is that the
restricted universal quantification used in the resolution is taken
from the assumptions.

Given a theorem-tactic {ttac}, applying the tactic {RESQ_RES_THEN
ttac} to a goal {(asml,gl)} has the effect of:
{
   MAP_EVERY (mapfilter ttac [... ; (ai,aj |- vi) ; ...]) (amsl ?- g)
}
where the theorems {ai,aj |- vi} are all the consequences that can be
drawn by a (single) matching modus-ponens inference from the
assumptions {amsl} and the implications derived from the restricted
universal quantifications in the assumptions.

\FAILURE
Evaluating {RESQ_RES_TAC ttac th} fails if there are no restricted
universal quantifications in the assumptions, or if the theorem-tactic
{ttac} applied to all the consequences fails.

@\DOC PSELECT_CONV

\TYPE {PSELECT_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, epsilon.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates a paired epsilon term by introducing a existential quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {PSELECT_CONV} expects a boolean term of the form
{"t[@@p.t[p]/p]"}, which asserts that the epsilon term {@@p.t[p]} denotes
a pair, {p} say, for which {t[p]} holds.  This assertion is equivalent
to saying that there exists such a pair, and {PSELECT_CONV} applied to a
term of this form returns the theorem {|- t[@@p.t[p]/p] = ?p. t[p]}.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form {"p[@@p.t[p]/p]"}.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

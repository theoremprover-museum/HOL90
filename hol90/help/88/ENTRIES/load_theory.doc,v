@\DOC load_theory

\TYPE {load_theory : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads an existing theory into the system.

\DESCRIBE
A call {load_theory `thy`} loads the existing theory {thy} into the system
and makes it the current theory. The message `{Theory thy loaded}' is printed.
The theory is entered in proof mode. Whilst in this mode only theorems may be
added to the theory segment.

\FAILURE
A call to {load_theory `thy`} will fail if theory {thy} does not appear on
the current search path. It will fail if theory {thy} is not a descendant of
the current theory. It will fail if an ancestor of theory {thy} has been
extended with either new types or constants which clash with names in theory
{thy}. It will also fail if any of the theory files of the theory {thy}
have been damaged. On failure, the system recovers cleanly, unloading any
theory segments it had loaded before the failure was detected. It will diverge
if the theory hierarchy within theory {thy} contains loops, so that a theory
segment is its own ancestor.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

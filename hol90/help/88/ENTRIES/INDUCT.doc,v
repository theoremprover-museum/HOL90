@\DOC INDUCT

\TYPE {INDUCT : ((thm # thm) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs a proof by mathematical induction on the natural numbers.

\KEYWORDS
rule, induction.

\DESCRIBE
The derived inference rule {INDUCT} implements the rule of mathematical
induction:
{
      A1 |- P[0]      A2 |- !n. P[n] ==> P[SUC n]
    -----------------------------------------------  INDUCT
               A1 u A2 |- !n. P[n]
}
\noindent When supplied with a theorem {A1 |- P[0]}, which asserts the base
case of a proof of the proposition {P[n]} by induction on {n}, and the theorem
{A2 |- !n. P[n] ==> P[SUC n]}, which asserts the step case in the induction on
{n}, the inference rule {INDUCT} returns {A1 u A2 |- !n. P[n]}.

\FAILURE
{INDUCT th1 th2} fails if the theorems {th1} and {th2} do not have the forms
{A1 |- P[0]} and {A2 |- !n. P[n] ==> P[SUC n]} respectively.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

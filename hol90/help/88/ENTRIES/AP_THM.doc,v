@\DOC AP_THM

\TYPE {AP_THM : (thm -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of equal functions applied to a term.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- f = g} and a term {x}, the inference
rule {AP_THM} returns the theorem {A |- f x = g x}.
{
      A |- f = g
   ----------------  AP_THM (A |- f = g) "x"
    A |- f x = g x
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the conclusion of the theorem is an equation, both sides
of which are functions whose domain type is the same as that of the
supplied term.

\COMMENTS
The type of {AP_THM} is shown by the system as {thm -> conv}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

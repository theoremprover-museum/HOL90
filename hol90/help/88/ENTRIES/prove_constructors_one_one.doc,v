@\DOC prove_constructors_one_one

\TYPE {prove_constructors_one_one : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves that the constructors of an automatically-defined concrete type are
injective.

\DESCRIBE
{prove_constructors_one_one} takes as its argument a primitive recursion
theorem, in the form returned by {define_type} for an automatically-defined
concrete type.  When applied to such a theorem, {prove_constructors_one_one}
automatically proves and returns a theorem which states that the constructors
of the concrete type in question are injective (one-to-one).  The resulting
theorem covers only those constructors that take arguments (i.e. that are not
just constant values).

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument is not a theorem of the form returned by {define_type},
or if all the constructors of the concrete type in question are simply
constants of that type.

\EXAMPLE
Given the following primitive recursion theorem for labelled binary trees:
{
   |- !f0 f1.
        ?! fn.
        (!x. fn(LEAF x) = f0 x) /\
        (!b1 b2. fn(NODE b1 b2) = f1(fn b1)(fn b2)b1 b2)
}
\noindent {prove_constructors_one_one} proves and returns the theorem:
{
   |- (!x x'. (LEAF x = LEAF x') = (x = x')) /\
      (!b1 b2 b1' b2'.
        (NODE b1 b2 = NODE b1' b2') = (b1 = b1') /\ (b2 = b2'))
}
\noindent This states that the constructors {LEAF} and {NODE} are both
injective.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

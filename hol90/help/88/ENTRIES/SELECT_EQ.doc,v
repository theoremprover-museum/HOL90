@\DOC SELECT_EQ

\TYPE {SELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon, equality.

\DESCRIBE
Effects the extensionality of the epsilon operator {@@}.
{
       A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------  SELECT_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (@@x.t1) = (@@x.t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation, or if the
variable {x} is free in {A}.

\EXAMPLE
Given a theorem which shows the equivalence of two distinct forms of
defining the property of being an even number:
{
   th = |- (x MOD 2 = 0) = (?y. x = 2 * y)
}
\noindent A theorem giving the equivalence of the epsilon abstraction of each
form is obtained:
{
   #SELECT_EQ "x:num" th;;
   |- (@@x. x MOD 2 = 0) = (@@x. ?y. x = 2 * y)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

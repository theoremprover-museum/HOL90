@\DOC union

\TYPE {union : ('a list -> 'a list -> 'a list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the union of two `sets'.

\KEYWORDS
list, set.

\DESCRIBE
If {l1} and {l2} are both sets (a list with no repeated members), 
{union l1 l2} returns the set union of {l1} and {l2}. In the case that 
{l1} or {l2} is not a set, all the user can depend on is that {union l1 l2}
returns a list {l3} such that every unique element of {l1} and {l2} is in 
{l3} and each element of {l3} is found in either {l1} or {l2}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
- union [1,2,3] [1,5,4,3];
val it = [2,1,5,4,3] : int list

- union [1,1,1] [1,2,3,2];
val it = [1,2,3,2] : int list

- union [1,2,3,2] [1,1,1] ;
val it = [3,2,1,1,1] : int list
}

\COMMENTS
Do not make the assumption that the order of items in the list is fixed. 
Later implementations may use different algorithms, and return a 
different concrete result while still meeting the specification.

High performance set operations may be found in the SML/NJ library.

\SEEALSO
setify, set_equal, intersect, subtract.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {OR_PFORALL_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, disjunction.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification outwards through a disjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(!p. t) \/ (!p. u)}, where no variables
from {p} are free in either {t} nor {u}, {OR_PFORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (!p. t) \/ (!p. u) = (!p. t \/ u)
}
\FAILURE
{OR_PFORALL_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{(!p. t) \/ (!p. u)}, or if it is applied to a term {(!p. t) \/ (!p. u)}
in which the variables from {p} are free in either {t} or {u}.

@\DOC EVERY_ASSUM

\TYPE {EVERY_ASSUM : (thm_tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sequentially applies all tactics given by mapping a function over the
assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactic {f} and a goal {({{A1;...;An}} ?- C)}, the
{EVERY_ASSUM} tactical maps {f} over a list of {ASSUME}d assumptions then
applies the resulting tactics, in sequence, to the goal:
{
   EVERY_ASSUM f ({{A1;...;An}} ?- C)
    = (f(A1 |- A1) THEN ... THEN f(An |- An)) ({{A1;...;An}} ?- C)
}
\noindent If the goal has no assumptions, then {EVERY_ASSUM} has no effect.

\FAILURE
The application of {EVERY_ASSUM} to a theorem-tactic and a goal fails
if the theorem-tactic fails when applied to any of the {ASSUME}d assumptions
of the goal, or if any of the resulting tactics fail when applied
sequentially.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

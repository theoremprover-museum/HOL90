\TYPE {constants : (string -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the constants defined in a named theory.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   constants `thy`
}
\noindent where {thy} is an ancestor theory (the special string {`-`} means the
current theory), returns a list of all the constants in that theory.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory does not exist, or is not an ancestor of the
current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#constants `combin`;;
["I"; "S"; "K"; "$o"] : term list
}
\SEEALSO
axioms, binders, definitions, infixes, theorems

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE

\TYPE {PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE : (string list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prunes several hidden variables.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE [`li1`;...;`lik`]} behaves as follows:
{
    A |- !z1 ... zr.
          t = ?l1 ... lr. t1 /\ ... /\ eqni1 /\ ... /\ eqnik /\ ... /\ tp
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------
           A |- !z1 ... zr. t = ?li(k+1) ... lir. t1 /\ ... /\ tp
}
\noindent where for {1 <= j <= k}, each {eqnij} has the form:
{
   "!y1 ... ym. lij x1 ... xn = b"
}
\noindent and {lij} does not appear free in any of the other conjuncts or in
{b}. The {li}'s are related by the equation:
{
   {{li1,...,lik}} u {{li(k+1),...,lir}} = {{l1,...,lr}}
}
\noindent The rule works if one or more of the {eqnij}'s are not present, that
is if {lij} is not free in any of the conjuncts, but does not work if {lij}
appears free in more than one of the conjuncts. {p} may be zero, that is, all
the conjuncts may be {eqnij}'s. In this case the conjunction will be
transformed to {T} (true). Also, for each {eqnij}, {m} and {n} may be zero.

If there is more than one line with a specified name (but with different
types), the one that appears outermost in the existential quantifications is
pruned. If such a line name is mentioned twice in the list, the two outermost
occurrences of lines with that name will be pruned, and so on.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument theorem is not of the specified form or if any of the
{lij}'s are free in more than one of the conjuncts or if the equation for any
{lij} is recursive. The function also fails if any of the specified lines are
not one of the existentially quantified lines.

\EXAMPLE
{
#PRUNE_SOME_RIGHT_RULE [`l1`;`l2`]
# (ASSUME
#   "!(in:num->bool) (out:num->bool).
#     DEV (in,out) =
#      ?(l1:num->bool) l2.
#       (!x. l1 x = F) /\ (!x. l2 x = ~(in x)) /\ (!x. out x = ~(in x))");;
. |- !in out. DEV(in,out) = (!x. out x = ~in x)

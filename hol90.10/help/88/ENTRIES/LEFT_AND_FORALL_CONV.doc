\DOC LEFT_AND_FORALL_CONV

\TYPE {LEFT_AND_FORALL_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a universal quantification of the left conjunct outwards through a
conjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(!x.P) /\ Q}, the conversion
{LEFT_AND_FORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (!x.P) /\ Q = (!x'. P[x'/x] /\ Q)
}
\noindent where {x'} is a primed variant of {x} that does not appear free in
the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {(!x.P) /\ Q}.

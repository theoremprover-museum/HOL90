@\DOC RIGHT_IMP_PFORALL_CONV

\TYPE {RIGHT_IMP_PFORALL_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, implication.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification of the consequent outwards through an
implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {t ==> (!p. u)}, the conversion
{RIGHT_IMP_FORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- t ==> (!p. u) = (!p'. t ==> (u[p'/p]))
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of the pair {p} that does not
contain any variables that appear free in the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {t ==> (!p. u)}.

\SEEALSO
RIGHT_IMP_FORALL_CONV, PFORALL_IMP_CONV, LEFT_IMP_PEXISTS_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

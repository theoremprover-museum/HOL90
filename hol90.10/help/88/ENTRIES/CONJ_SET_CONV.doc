\DOC CONJ_SET_CONV

\TYPE {CONJ_SET_CONV : (term list -> term list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves the equivalence of the conjunctions of two equal sets of terms.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
The arguments to {CONJ_SET_CONV} are two lists of terms {[t1;...;tn]} and
{[u1;...;um]}.  If these are equal when considered as sets, that is if the sets
{
   {{t1,...,tn}} and {{u1,...,um}}
}
\noindent are equal, then {CONJ_SET_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (t1 /\ ... /\ tn) = (u1 /\ ... /\ um)
}
\noindent Otherwise {CONJ_SET_CONV} fails.

\FAILURE
{CONJ_SET_CONV [t1;...;tn] [u1;...;um]} fails if {[t1,...,tn]} and
{[u1,...,um]}, regarded as sets of terms, are not equal. Also fails
if any {ti} or {ui} does not have type {bool}.

\USES
Used to order conjuncts.  First sort a list of conjuncts {l1} into the
desired order to get a new list {l2}, then call {CONJ_SET_CONV l1 l2}.

\COMMENTS
This is not a true conversion, so perhaps it ought to be called something else.

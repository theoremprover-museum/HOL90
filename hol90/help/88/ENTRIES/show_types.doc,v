@\DOC show_types

\TYPE {show_types : (bool -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Turns printing of HOL types (in terms) on/off.

\DESCRIBE
Normally HOL types in terms are not printed, since this makes terms hard to
read. Type printing is enabled by {show_types true}, and disabled by
{show_types false}. When printing of types is enabled, not all variables and
constants are annotated with a type. The intention is to provide sufficient
type information to remove any ambiguities without swamping the term with type
information.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#BOOL_CASES_AX;;
|- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F)

#show_types true;;
false : bool

#BOOL_CASES_AX;;
|- !(t:bool). (t = T) \/ (t = F)
}
\COMMENTS
It is possible to construct an abstraction in which the bound variable has the
same name but a different type to a variable in the body. In such a case the
two variables are considered to be distinct. Without type information such a
term can be very misleading, so it might be a good idea to provide type
information for the free variable whether or not printing of types is enabled.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC dropout

\TYPE {dropout : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Move from top-level ML to top-level Lisp.

\DESCRIBE
Unlike {lsp}, which breaks out of ML, and leaves one in a position to
return to it by continuing lisp execution, {dropout} returns the user to
the Lisp top-level.  The function {(tml)} must then be invoked to return to
ML.  This is inherently dangerous (internal state may not be consistent),
and should be avoided.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
          _  _    __    _      __    __
   |___   |__|   |  |   |     |__|  |__|
   |      |  |   |__|   |__   |__|  |__|

\COMMENTS
The behaviour of {dropout} is unpredictable in Common Lisp, but performs as
advertised in plain Franz Lisp.  {dropout} is not meant for general use, and
should be treated with great care.  If one is not wary, it is entirely possible
to corrupt HOL by using it.

@\DOC rev_assoc

\TYPE {Compat.rev_assoc : ''a -> ('b * ''a) list -> ('b * ''a)}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches a list of pairs for a pair whose second component equals a specified
value.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. {rev_assoc y [(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)]} returns
the first {(xi,yi)} in the list such that {yi} equals {y}. The lookup is
done on an eqtype, i.e., the SML implementation must be able to decide
equality for the type of {y}.

\FAILURE
Fails if no matching pair is found. This will always be the case if the list
is empty. The function will not be available if the hol88 library has not
been loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - rev_assoc 2 [(1,4),(3,2),(2,5),(2,6)];
  (3, 2) : (int * int)
}

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since we use an option type instead of exceptions.

    assoc1;
    val it = fn : ''a -> (''a * 'b) list -> (''a * 'b) option
    - assoc2;
    val it = fn : ''a -> ('b * ''a) list -> ('b * ''a) option

\SEEALSO
assoc, find, mem, tryfind, exists, forall.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC int_of_string

\TYPE {Compat.int_of_string : string -> int}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps a string of numbers to the corresponding integer.

\DESCRIBE
Given a string representing an integer in standard decimal notation,
possibly including a leading plus sign or minus sign and/or leading zeros,
{int_of_string} returns the corresponding integer constant.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the string is a valid decimal representation as specified
above.

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since the author always got it backwards; use 
{string_to_int} instead. Likewise, {string_of_int} is not found in hol90; use 
{int_to_string}.

\SEEALSO
ascii, ascii_code, string_of_int, int_to_string, string_to_int.

log

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

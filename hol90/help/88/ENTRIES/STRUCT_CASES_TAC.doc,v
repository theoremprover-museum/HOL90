@\DOC STRUCT_CASES_TAC

\TYPE {STRUCT_CASES_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs very general structural case analysis.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, cases.

\DESCRIBE
When it is applied to a theorem of the form:
{
   th = A' |- ?y11...y1m. (x=t1) /\ (B11 /\ ... /\ B1k) \/ ... \/
                ?yn1...ynp. (x=tn) /\ (Bn1 /\ ... /\ Bnp)
}
\noindent in which there may be no existential quantifiers where a `vector' of
them is shown above, {STRUCT_CASES_TAC th} splits a goal {A ?- s} into {n}
subgoals as follows:
{
                             A ?- s
   ===============================================================
    A u {{B11,...,B1k}} ?- s[t1/x] ... A u {{Bn1,...,Bnp}} ?- s[tn/x]
}
\noindent that is, performs a case split over the possible constructions (the
{ti}) of a term, providing as assumptions the given constraints, having
split conjoined constraints into separate assumptions. Note that unless {A'}
is a subset of {A}, this is an invalid tactic.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem has the above form, namely a conjunction of
(possibly multiply existentially quantified) terms which assert the equality
of the same variable {x} and the given terms.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose we have the goal:
{
  ?- ~(l:(*)list = []) ==> (LENGTH l) > 0
}
\noindent then we can get rid of the universal quantifier from the
inbuilt list theorem {list_CASES}:
{
   list_CASES = !l. (l = []) \/ (?t h. l = CONS h t)
}
\noindent and then use {STRUCT_CASES_TAC}. This amounts to applying the
following tactic:
{
   STRUCT_CASES_TAC (SPEC_ALL list_CASES)
}
\noindent which results in the following two subgoals:
{
   ?- ~(CONS h t = []) ==> (LENGTH(CONS h t)) > 0

   ?- ~([] = []) ==> (LENGTH[]) > 0
}
\noindent Note that this is a rather simple case, since there are no
constraints, and therefore the resulting subgoals have no assumptions.

\USES
Generating a case split from the axioms specifying a structure.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

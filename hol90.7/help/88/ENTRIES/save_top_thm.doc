\TYPE {save_top_thm : (string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Stores the theorem just proved with the subgoal package in the current theory
segment.

\DESCRIBE
The function {save_top_thm} is part of the subgoal package.  A proof state of
the package consists of either goal and justification stacks if a proof is in
progress or a theorem if a proof has just been completed. If the proof state
consists of a theorem, the call {save_top_thm `name`} adds that theorem to the
current theory segment under the name {name}. The theorem is returned as a
value. The name {name} must be a distinct name within the theory segment, but
may be the same as for items within other theory segments of the theory. If the
current theory segment is named {thy}, the theorem will be written to the
file {thy.th} in the directory from which HOL was called. If the system is in
draft mode, other changes made to the current theory segment  during the
session will also be written to the theory file. If the theory file does not
exist, it will be created. The call can be made in both proof and draft mode.
For a description of the subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
A call to {save_top_thm} will fail if the proof state does not hold a theorem.
This will be so either because no goal has been set or because a proof is in
progress with unproven subgoals. It will fail if the name given is the same as
the name of an existing fact in the current theory segment.
Storing the theorem involves writing to the file system. If the write fails for
any reason {save_top_thm} will fail. For example, on start up the initial
theory is {HOL}. The associated theory files are read-only so an attempt to
store a theorem in that theory segment will fail.

\USES
Adding theorems to the current theory. Saving theorems for retrieval
in later sessions. The theorem may be retrieved using the function
{theorem}.  Binding the result of {save_top_thm} to an ML variable makes it
easy to access the theorem in the current terminal session.

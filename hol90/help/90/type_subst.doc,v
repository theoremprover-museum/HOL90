\TYPE {type_subst : hol_type subst -> hol_type -> hol_type}

\SYNOPSIS
Instantiates types in a type.

\DESCRIBE
If {theta = [{{redex1,residue1}},...,{{redexn,residuen}}]} is a hol_type subst,
where the redexi are the types to be substituted for, and the residuei the 
replacements, and {ty} is a type to instantiate, the call
{
   type_subst theta ty
}
\noindent will appropriately instantiate the type {ty}. The instantiations 
will be performed in parallel. If several of the type instantiations are
applicable, the choice is undefined. Each {redexi} ought to be a type
variable, but if it isn't, it will never be replaced. Also, it is not 
necessary that any or all of the types {t1...tn} should in fact appear in {ty}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - type_subst [{{redex = (==`:'a`==), residue = (==`:bool`==)}}]
               (==`:'a # 'b`==);
  (==`:bool # 'b`==) : hol_type

  - type_subst [{{redex = (==`:'a # 'b`==), residue = (==`:num`==)}},
                {{redex = (==`:'a`==), residue = (==`:bool`==)}}] 
              (==`:'a # 'b`==);
  (==`:bool # 'b`==) : hol_type
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC autoload_theory

\TYPE {autoload_theory : ((string # string # string) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes an axiom, definition or theorem autoload when mentioned.

\DESCRIBE
After a call {autoload_theory(`kind`,`thy`,`name`)}, a subsequent occurrence of
the name {name} in an ML phrase will cause the relevant autoloading action.
The {kind} value should be one of {axiom}, {definition} (this includes type
definitions) or {theorem}, and the appropriate entity called {name} will be
loaded from theory {thy} before the ML phrase containing {name} is evaluated.

\FAILURE
Never fails, although the subsequent autoloading action may do.

\EXAMPLE
The following autoload is not necessary because {ETA_AX} is already bound to an
identifier when HOL is started. However, it shows the general idea.
{
   #autoload_theory(`axiom`,`bool`,`ETA_AX`);;
   () : void

   #ETA_AX;;
   Axiom ETA_AX autoloaded from theory `bool`.
   ETA_AX = |- !t. (\x. t x) = t

   |- !t. (\x. t x) = t
}
\COMMENTS
More general automatic actions can be achieved using {autoload}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

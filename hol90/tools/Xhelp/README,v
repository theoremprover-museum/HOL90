@  Changes made in hol90.4:
 
  NOTE that this program assumes that the HOL90 help files are in
  the directory HOL90_HELP_PATH/ENTRIES (similarly THEORIES, if any.)
  However, if you move the help files hol90's internal help probably
  won't be able to find then. To circumvent this, just do the
  following: 

    cd <hol-base>/help
    mv 90 ENTRIES
    ln -s ENTRIES 90

  Both help facilities will then work. In future releases this should
  be unnecessay as hol will look for help files in ENTRIES by default.


  To compile Xholhelp:

  Change the three paths variables in the file INSTALL_XHOLHELP, save
  the changes and execute (the file.)


  For the record:

  Changes By: MJ Morley, University of Edinburgh <mjm@@lfcs.ed.ac.uk>
  (so queries about this program ought to be forwarded to /dev/null!)
 
  1. Added HOL90_HELP_PATH which xholhelp will consult FIRST by
     default. 
 
  2. Changed sed script for apropos as record types now need dealing
     with.
 
  3. Changed mode for INSTALL_XHOLHELP so it's owner executable.

  4. Changed code for apropo so that if the dialog box is empty a list
     of all help files (in path) will be given.

  5. Provided a cheap and nasty script for 4 (hol_funs.orig)

  6. Added dialog boxes under "theorems" button (right mouse) and
     (new) "pathedit" button (left mouse) so users can dynamically fix
     the help paths for xholhelp.

  7. Modified hol_xxx.orig scripts to invoke /bin/sh and handle extra
     paramater (user defined help_path) passed to them from the program.

  8. Modifies INSTALL script so that things still work if either (or
     both) the default help paths are left blank. (They shouldn't be
     though, as users won't know where they are.)

  9. Ooops! Nearly forgot to update the xholhelp help file.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

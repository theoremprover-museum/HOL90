\DOC EXISTS_LEAST_CONV

\TYPE {EXISTS_LEAST_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies the well-ordering property of the natural numbers.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, number, wellordering, induction.

\DESCRIBE
Given a term of the form {"?n:num.P[n]"}, the conversion {EXISTS_LEAST_CONV}
proves that this assertion is equivalent to the statement that there is a
least number {n} such that {P[n]} holds.  The theorem returned is:
{
   |- (?n. P[n]) = ?n. P[n] /\ !n'. (n' < n) ==> ~P[n']
}
\noindent where {n'} is a primed variant of {n} that does not appear free in
the input term.  Note that the variable {n} need not in fact appear free in
the body of the existentially-quantified input term.  For example,
{EXISTS_LEAST_CONV "?n:num.T"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (?n. T) = (?n. T /\ (!n'. n' < n ==> ~T))
}
\FAILURE
{EXISTS_LEAST_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form {"?n:num.P"}.

@\DOC new_binder_resq_definition

\TYPE {new_binder_resq_definition : ((string # term) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declare a new binder and install a definitional axiom in the current theory.

\KEYWORDS
definition, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
The function {new_binder_resq_definition} provides a facility for definitional
extensions to the current theory. The new constant defined using this
function may take arguments which are restricted quantified.  The
function {new_binder_resq_definition} takes a pair argument consisting 
of the name under which the resulting definition will be saved
in the current theory segment, and a term giving the desired definition.  The
value returned by {new_binder_resq_definition} is a theorem which states the
definition requested by the user.

Let {x_1,...,x_n} be distinct variables.  Evaluating
{
   new_binder_resq_definition (`name`,
    "!x_i::P_i. ... !x_j::P_j. B x_1 ... x_n = t")
} 
where {B} is not already a constant, {i} is greater or equal to 1 and
{i <= j <= n}, declares {B} to be a new constant in the current theory
with this definition as its specification. 
This constant specification is returned as a theorem with the form
{
   |- !x_i::P_i. ... !x_j::P_j. !x_k .... B x_1 ... x_n = t
}
\noindent where the variables {x_k} are the free variables occurring on
the left hand side of the definition and are not restricted
quantified. This theorem is saved in the current theory under
(the name) {name}. 

The constant {B} defined by this function will have the binder status
only after the definition has been processed. It is therefore necessary to use
the constant in normal prefix position when making the definition.
 
If the restricting predicates {P_l} contains free occurrence of
variable(s) of the left hand side, the constant {B} will stand for a
family of functions.

\FAILURE
{new_binder_resq_definition} fails if called when HOL is not in draft mode.  It also
fails if there is already an axiom, definition or specification of the given
name in the current theory segment; if {`B`} is already a constant in the
current theory or is not an allowed name for a constant; if {t} contains free
variables that do not occur in the left hand side, or if
any variable occurs more than once in {x_1, ..., x_n}.  Finally, failure occurs
if there is a type variable in {x_1}, ..., {x_n} or {t} that does not occur in
the type of {B}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

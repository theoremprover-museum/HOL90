@\DOC ADD_CONV

\TYPE {ADD_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Calculates by inference the sum of two numerals.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{ADD_CONV "m + n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m + n = s
}
\noindent where {s} is the numeral that denotes the sum of the natural
numbers denoted by {m} and {n}.

\FAILURE
{ADD_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m + n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ADD_CONV "75 + 25";;
|- 75 + 25 = 100
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

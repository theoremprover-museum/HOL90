@\DOC FORALL_ARITH_CONV

\TYPE {FORALL_ARITH_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Partial decision procedure for non-existential Presburger natural arithmetic.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
{FORALL_ARITH_CONV} is a partial decision procedure for formulae of Presburger
natural arithmetic which are in prenex normal form and have all variables
either free or universally quantified. Presburger natural arithmetic is the
subset of arithmetic formulae made up from natural number constants, numeric
variables, addition, multiplication by a constant, the relations {<}, {<=},
{=}, {>=}, {>} and the logical connectives {~}, {/\}, {\/}, {==>},
{=} (if-and-only-if), {!} (`forall') and {?} (`there exists'). Products of two
expressions which both contain variables are not included in the subset, but
the function {SUC} which is not normally included in a specification of
Presburger arithmetic is allowed in this HOL implementation.

Given a formula in the specified subset, the function attempts to prove that
it is equal to {T} (true). The procedure only works if the formula would also
be true of the non-negative rationals; it cannot prove formulae whose truth
depends on the integral properties of the natural numbers.

\FAILURE
The function can fail in two ways. It fails if the argument term is not a
formula in the specified subset, and it also fails if it is unable to prove
the formula. The failure strings are different in each case.

\EXAMPLE
{
#FORALL_ARITH_CONV "m < SUC m";;
|- m < (SUC m) = T

#FORALL_ARITH_CONV "!m n p q. m <= p /\ n <= q ==> (m + n) <= (p + q)";;
|- (!m n p q. m <= p /\ n <= q ==> (m + n) <= (p + q)) = T

#FORALL_ARITH_CONV "!m n. ~(SUC (2 * m) = 2 * n)";;
evaluation failed     FORALL_ARITH_CONV -- cannot prove formula
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

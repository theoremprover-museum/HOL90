\DOC set_help

\TYPE {set_help : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specifies a filter to pipe help output through.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {set_help `filter`} will make future help output (generated in
response to a {help} command) be piped through the program {filter}. The
function returns the name of the previous filter. The default is {cat}, so
output is just sent to the console. Previous versions of HOL used {more} by
default.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#set_help `lpr`;;
`cat` : string
}
\noindent This causes the help file to be printed instead of being displayed.

@\DOC AP_TERM

\TYPE {AP_TERM : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a function to both sides of an equational theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {f} and a theorem {A |- x = y}, the
inference rule {AP_TERM} returns the theorem {A |- f x = f y}.
{
      A |- x = y
   ----------------  AP_TERM "f"
    A |- f x = f y
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational and the supplied term is a function
whose domain type is the same as the type of both sides of the equation.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

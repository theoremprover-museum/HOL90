1.1.2.1
log
@Modifications to the Meson library to bring it into line with the
latest version of John Harrison's MESON_TAC in gtt (HOL Light).

The additional files do the following things:
  canon_port.sml: provide functionality similar to that of the Canon
                  structure, but in a way that is also compatible with
                  John's code.  (The existing Canon does not do this.)
  jrhtactics.sml: provide a tactic mechanism that uses theorems on the
                  assumption list rather than terms to further mimic the
                  implementation strategy in John's code.  (The code also
                  uses a fringe-based approach to the goal-state that is
                  quite elegant, but this is pretty much by-the-by.)

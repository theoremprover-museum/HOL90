@\DOC UNWIND_AUTO_RIGHT_RULE

\TYPE {UNWIND_AUTO_RIGHT_RULE : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Automatic unwinding of equations defining wire values in a standard device
specification.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{UNWIND_AUTO_RIGHT_RULE} behaves as follows:
{
    A |- !z1 ... zr. t = ?l1 ... lm. t1  /\ ... /\ tn
   ----------------------------------------------------
    A |- !z1 ... zr. t = ?l1 ... lm. t1' /\ ... /\ tn'
}
\noindent where {tj'} is {tj} rewritten with equations selected from the
{ti}'s.

The function decides which equations to use for rewriting by performing a loop
analysis on the graph representing the dependencies of the lines. By this means
the term can be unwound as much as possible without the risk of looping. The
user is left to deal with the recursive equations.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is more than one equation for any line variable, or if the
argument theorem is not of the required form, though either or both of {m} and
{r} may be zero.

\EXAMPLE
{
#UNWIND_AUTO_RIGHT_RULE
# (ASSUME
#   "!f. IMP(f) =
#     ?l2 l1.
#      (!(x:num). l1 x = (l2 x) - 1) /\
#      (!x. f x = (l2 (x+1)) + (l1 (x+2))) /\
#      (!x. l2 x = 7)");;
. |- !f.
      IMP f =
      (?l2 l1.
        (!x. l1 x = 7 - 1) /\ (!x. f x = 7 + (7 - 1)) /\ (!x. l2 x = 7))
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC LIST_MP

\TYPE {LIST_MP : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs a chain of Modus Ponens inferences.

\KEYWORDS
rule, modus, ponens.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- t1, ..., An |- tn} and a theorem which is a
chain of implications with the successive antecedents the same as the
conclusions of the theorems in the list (up to alpha-conversion),
{A |- t1 ==> ... ==> tn ==> t}, the {LIST_MP} inference rule performs a chain
of {MP} inferences to deduce {A u A1 u ... u An |- t}.
{
    A1 |- t1 ... An |- tn      A |- t1 ==> ... ==> tn ==> t
   ---------------------------------------------------------  LIST_MP
                    A u A1 u ... u An |- t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is a chain of implications whose consequents are the
same as the conclusions of the list of theorems (up to alpha-conversion), in
sequence.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

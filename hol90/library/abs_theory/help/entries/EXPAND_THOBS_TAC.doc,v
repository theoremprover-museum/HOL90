@\DOC EXPAND_THOBS_TAC

\TYPE {EXPAND_THOBS_TAC : (string -> tactic)}


\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS 
Expands a goal using the abstract definition and theory
obligations for the named theory.

\DESCRIBE When applied to a goal {A ?- thob_def(rep)}, where
{thob_def} is a theory obligation and {rep} is a representation, the
tactic expands the definition of the theory obligation and reduces the
terms resulting from the abstract definitions.  This tactic is usually the
first step in proving that a given representation meets the abstract theory
obligations.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory is not an ancestor.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

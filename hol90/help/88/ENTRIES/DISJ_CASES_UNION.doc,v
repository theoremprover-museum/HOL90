@\DOC DISJ_CASES_UNION

\TYPE {DISJ_CASES_UNION : (thm -> thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes an inference for each arm of a disjunct.

\KEYWORDS
rule, disjunction, cases.

\DESCRIBE
Given a disjunctive theorem, and two additional theorems each having one
disjunct as a hypothesis, a new theorem with a conclusion that is the
disjunction of the conclusions of the last two theorems is produced. The
hypotheses include the union of hypotheses of all three theorems less the two
disjuncts.
{
    A |- t1 \/ t2    A1 u {{t1}} |- t3     A2 u {{t2}} |- t4
   ------------------------------------------------------  DISJ_CASES_UNION
                 A u A1 u A2 |- t3 \/ t4
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the first theorem is not a disjunction.

\EXAMPLE
The built-in theorem {LESS_CASES} can be specialized to:
{
   th1 = |- m < n \/ n <= m
}
\noindent and used with two additional theorems:
{
   th2 = (m < n |- (m MOD n = m))
   th3 = ({{0 < n, n <= m}} |- (m MOD n) = ((m - n) MOD n))
}
\noindent to derive a new theorem:
{
   #DISJ_CASES_UNION th1 th2 th3;;
   ["0 < n"] |- (m MOD n = m) \/ (m MOD n = (m - n) MOD n)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {Compat.tyvarsl : (term list -> type list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the type variables free in a list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of terms, {tyvarsl} returns a list (possibly empty) of
the type variables which are free in any of those terms.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - tyvarsl [--`!x. x = 1`--, --`!x:'a. x = x`--];
  [(==`:'a`==)] : hol_type list
}
\USES
Finding all the free type variables in the assumptions of a theorem, as a check
on the validity of certain inferences.

\COMMENTS
{tyvarsl} does not appear in hol90. In the current HOL logic, there is no 
binding operation for types, so `is free in' is synonymous with `appears in'.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\SYNOPSIS
Tactic to solve a goal about the size of a word.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- PWORDLEN n tm}, the tactic {PWORDLEN_TAC tms}
solves it if the conversion {PWORDLEN_CONV tms} returns a theorem
{
   A' |- PWORDLEN n tm
}
\noindent where {A'} is either empty or every clause in it occurs in the
assumption of the goal {A}.
Otherwise, each clause in {A'} which does not appear in {A} becomes a new
subgoal.

\FAILURE
{PWORDLEN_TAC tms} fails if the corresponding conversion
{PWORDLEN_CONV} fails.

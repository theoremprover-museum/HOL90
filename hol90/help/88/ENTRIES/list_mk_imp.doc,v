@\DOC list_mk_imp

\TYPE {list_mk_imp : (goal -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively constructs implications.

\DESCRIBE
{list_mk_imp(["t1";...;"tn"],"t")} returns {"t1 ==> ( ... (tn ==> t)...)"}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {list_mk_imp} if any of {t1},...,{tn} are not of type {":bool"} or
if the list of terms is non-empty and {t} is not of type {":bool"}. If the
list of terms is empty the type of {t} can be anything.

\EXAMPLE
{
#list_mk_imp (["T";"F"],"T");;
"T ==> F ==> T" : term

#list_mk_imp (["T";"1"],"T");;
evaluation failed     list_mk_imp

#list_mk_imp (["T";"F"],"1");;
evaluation failed     list_mk_imp

#list_mk_imp ([],"1");;
"1" : term
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

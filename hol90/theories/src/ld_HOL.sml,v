@(*========================================================================
 * ld_HOL.sml
 *
 * Loader file for the HOL theory.  Could be remade automatically.
 *
 * The idea of this file is that if a structure depends
 * on having the HOL theory loaded, then it should go "open HOL"
 * at the top of the structure.  A compilation manager like CM will
 * then tell that this file needs to be laoded first.  This is the
 * only way of expressing such a dependency in CM.
 *
 * This file may be loaded multiple times without detriment.
 *
 * See also ld_BASIC_HOL.sml for more discussion on files of this sort.
 *======================================================================*)

1.1
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

\DOC load_definition

\TYPE {load_definition : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in a given definition from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, and {def} one of its definitions,
then
{
   load_definition `thy` `def`
}
\noindent attempts to load the corresponding definition, that is, to perform
dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let def = definition `thy` `def`;;
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {def} is not one of its
definitions.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_definition `bool` `FORALL_DEF`;;
() : void

FORALL_DEF = |- $! = (\P. P = (\x. T))

#FORALL_DEF;;
|- $! = (\P. P = (\x. T))
}
\USES
Useful for autoloading.

@\DOC library_search_path

\TYPE {library_search_path : (void -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the internal search path use by HOL to find libraries.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {library_search_path()} returns a list of strings representing the
pathnames of the directories that are searched when the {load_library} function
searches for libraries. Although the library search path can be set to an
arbitrary list of strings, each string is normally expected to be a pathname
with `{/}' as its final character.  When {load_library} looks for a library
load file, the directories in the library search path are searched in the order
in which they occur in the list returned by {library_search_path}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC CONJ_DISCH

\TYPE {CONJ_DISCH : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Discharges an assumption and conjoins it to both sides of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, conjunction, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
Given an term {t} and a theorem {A |- t1 = t2}, which is an equation between
boolean terms, {CONJ_DISCH} returns {A - {{t}} |- (t /\ t1) = (t /\ t2)}, i.e.
conjoins {t} to both sides of the equation, removing {t} from the assumptions
if it was there.
{
            A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------------  CONJ_DISCH "t"
    A - {{t}} |- t /\ t1 = t /\ t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is an equation, both sides of which, and the term
provided are of type {bool}.

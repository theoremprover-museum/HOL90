@\DOC SET_SPEC_CONV

\TYPE {SET_SPEC_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Axiom-scheme of specification for set abstractions.

\LIBRARY pred_sets

\DESCRIBE 
The conversion {SET_SPEC_CONV} expects its term argument to be an assertion of
the form {"t IN {{E | P}}"}. Given such a term, the conversion returns a
theorem that defines the condition under which this membership assertion holds.
When {E} is just a variable {v}, the conversion returns:
{
   |- t IN {{v | P}} = P[t/v]
}
\noindent and when {E} is not a variable but some other expression, the theorem
returned is:
{
   |- t IN {{E | P}} = ?x1...xn. (t = E) /\ P
}
\noindent where {x1}, ..., {xn} are the variables that occur free both in
the expression {E} and in the proposition {P}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#SET_SPEC_CONV "12 IN {{n | n > N}}";;
|- 12 IN {{n | n > N}} = 12 > N

#SET_SPEC_CONV "p IN {{(n,m) | n < m}}";;
|- p IN {{(n,m) | n < m}} = (?n m. (p = n,m) /\ n < m)
}

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form  {"t IN {{E | P}}"}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

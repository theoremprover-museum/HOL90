\TYPE {words : (string -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Splits a string into a list of words.

\KEYWORDS
string.

\DESCRIBE
{words s} splits the string {s} into a list of substrings. Splitting occurs
at each sequence of blanks and carriage returns (white space). This white
space does not appear in the list of substrings. Leading and trailing white
space in the input string is also thrown away.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#words `  the cat  sat on   the mat `;;
[`the`; `cat`; `sat`; `on`; `the`; `mat`] : string list
}
\USES
Useful when wanting to map a function over a list of constant strings.
Instead of using {[`string1`;...;`stringn`]} one can use:
{
   (words `string1 ... stringn`)
}

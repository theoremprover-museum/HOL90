\DOC print_thm

\TYPE {print_thm : (thm -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a HOL theorem to the terminal (abbreviating assumptions).

\DESCRIBE
{print_thm th} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the value
of {th} to the terminal. The text is not terminated with a carriage return.
In fact, the text is queued until the pretty-printer decides where line breaks
are needed, or until the queue is explicitly flushed.

Each assumption of the theorem is printed as one dot (period, full stop).

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_thm CONJ_SYM;;
|- !t1 t2. t1 /\ t2 = t2 /\ t1() : void
}

@\DOC prove_constructors_distinct

\TYPE {prove_constructors_distinct : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves that the constructors of an automatically-defined concrete type yield
distinct values.

\DESCRIBE
{prove_constructors_distinct} takes as its argument a primitive recursion
theorem, in the form returned by {define_type} for an automatically-defined
concrete type.  When applied to such a theorem, {prove_constructors_distinct}
automatically proves and returns a theorem which states that distinct
constructors of the concrete type in question yield distinct values of this
type.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument is not a theorem of the form returned by {define_type},
or if the concrete type in question has only one constructor.

\EXAMPLE
Given the following primitive recursion theorem for labelled binary trees:
{
   |- !f0 f1.
        ?! fn.
        (!x. fn(LEAF x) = f0 x) /\
        (!b1 b2. fn(NODE b1 b2) = f1(fn b1)(fn b2)b1 b2)
}
\noindent {prove_constructors_distinct} proves and returns the theorem:
{
   |- !x b1 b2. ~(LEAF x = NODE b1 b2)
}
\noindent This states that leaf nodes are different from internal nodes.  When
the concrete type in question has more than two constructors, the resulting
theorem is just conjunction of inequalities of this kind.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

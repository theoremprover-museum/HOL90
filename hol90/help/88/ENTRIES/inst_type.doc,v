\TYPE {inst_type : ((type # type) list -> type -> type)}

\SYNOPSIS
Instantiates types in a type.

\DESCRIBE
If {[(t1',t1);...;(tn',tn)]} is a list of type instantiations, where {t1...tn}
are the initial types, and {t1'...tn'} the desired instantiations, and {ty} is
a type to instantiate, the call
{
   inst_type [(t1',t1);...;(tn',tn)] ty
}
\noindent will appropriately instantiate the type {ty}. The instantiations will
be performed in parallel. If several of the type instantiations are applicable,
the choice is undefined. In normal use the {t1...tn} are type variables,
although this is not essential. Neither is it necessary that any or all of the
types {t1...tn} should in fact appear in {ty}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#inst_type [(":bool",":*")] ":* # **";;
":bool # **" : type

#inst_type [(":num",":* # **"); (":bool",":*")] ":* # **";;
":num" : type

#inst_type [(":bool",":*"); (":num",":* # **")] ":* # **";;
":num" : type

#inst_type [(":bool",":num"); (":num",":bool")] ":(bool)list";;
":(num)list" : type
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

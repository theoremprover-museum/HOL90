@\DOC EXT

\TYPE {EXT : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Derives equality of functions from extentional equivalence.

\KEYWORDS
rule, extentionality.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x. t1 x = t2 x}, the inference rule
{EXT} returns the theorem {A |- t1 = t2}.
{
    A |- !x. t1 x = t2 x
   ----------------------  EXT          [where x is not free in t1 or t2]
        A |- t1 = t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem does not have the form indicated above, or
if the variable {x} is free either of the functions {t1} or {t2}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

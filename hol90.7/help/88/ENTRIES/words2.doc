\TYPE {words2 : (string -> string -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Splits a string into a list of substrings, breaking at occurrences of a
specified character.

\KEYWORDS
string.

\DESCRIBE
{words2 char s} splits the string {s} into a list of substrings. Splitting
occurs at each occurrence of a sequence of the character {char}. The {char}
characters do not appear in the list of substrings. Leading and trailing
occurrences of {char} are also thrown away. If {char} is not a
single-character string (its length is not 1), then {s} will not be split and
so the result will be the list {[s]}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#words2 `/` `/the/cat//sat/on//the/mat/`;;
[`the`; `cat`; `sat`; `on`; `the`; `mat`] : string list

#words2 `//` `/the/cat//sat/on//the/mat/`;;
[`/the/cat//sat/on//the/mat/`] : string list
}

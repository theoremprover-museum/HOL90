@\label{theorems}

The sections that follow list all theorems in the \ml{sets} library, including
definitions. The theorems are grouped into sections according to subject
matter. Some theorems could be classified under more than one subject, but each
theorem is listed in only one section. The reader may therefore have to consult
more than one section when searching for any particular theorem.

When the \ml{sets} library is loaded, all the theorems listed in this chapter
(including definitions) are set up to autoload when their names are mentioned
in \ML.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

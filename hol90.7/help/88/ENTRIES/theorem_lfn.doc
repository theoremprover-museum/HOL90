\DOC theorem_lfn

\TYPE {theorem_lfn : (string list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads a given theorem from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is an ancestor theory, and {th} one of its theorems, then the call
{
   theorem_lfn [`thy`;`th`]
}
\noindent will return that theorem.

\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {th} is not one of its
theorems.

\EXAMPLE
{
#theorem_lfn [`num`;`NOT_SUC`];;
|- !n. ~(SUC n = 0)
}
\COMMENTS
This call has the same effect as {theorem `thy` `th`}.

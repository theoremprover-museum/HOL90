\DOC EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV

\TYPE {EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves that a nonempty bounded set of natural numbers has a greatest element.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, number.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV "(?x. P[x]) /\ (?y. !z. z > y ==> ~P[z])"
}
\noindent returns the theorem
{
   (?x. P[x]) /\ (?y. !z. z > y ==> ~P[z]) = ?x. P[x] /\ !z. z > x ==> ~P[z]
}
\noindent This expresses the equivalence of the statements `a property {P}
is true for some number {x}, and there is a limit {y} beyond which {P} is not
true' and `there is a greatest number such that {P} is true'.

\FAILURE
{EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has the form specified above.

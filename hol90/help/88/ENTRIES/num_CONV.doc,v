@\DOC num_CONV

\TYPE {num_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Provides definitional axiom for a nonzero numeral.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, number, arithmetic.

\DESCRIBE
{num_CONV} is an axiom-scheme from which one may obtain a defining equation for
any natural number constant not equal to {0} (i.e. {1}, {2}, {3},...).  If
{"n"} is such a constant, then {num_CONV "n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- n = SUC m
}
\noindent where {m} is the numeral that denotes the predecessor of the
number denoted by {n}.

\FAILURE
{num_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is {"0"} or if not {tm} is not a numeral constant.

\EXAMPLE
{
#num_CONV "3";;
|- 3 = SUC 2
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC new_constant

\TYPE {new_constant : ((string # type) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new constant in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_constant(`c`,":ty")} makes {c} a constant in the current theory.
Note that it does not specify its value. The constant may have a polymorphic
type, which can be used in arbitrary instantiations.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode, or if the name is not a valid constant
name, or there is already a constant of that name in the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#new_theory `zonk`;;
() : void

#new_constant(`graham's_number`,":num");;
() : void
}
\SEEALSO
constants, infixes, is_constant, is_infix, new_infix, new_definition,
new_infix_definition.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

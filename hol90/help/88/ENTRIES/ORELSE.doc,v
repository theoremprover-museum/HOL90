\SYNOPSIS
Applies first tactic, and iff it fails, applies the second instead.

If {T1} and {T2} are tactics, {T1 ORELSE T2} is a tactic which applies {T1} to
a goal, and iff it fails, applies {T2} to the goal instead.

The resulting tactic fails if both {T1} and {T2} fail when applied to the
relevant goal.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included

   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC load_axiom

\TYPE {load_axiom : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in a given axiom from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, and {ax} one of its axioms, then
{
   load_axiom `thy` `ax`
}
\noindent attempts to load the corresponding axiom, that is, to perform
dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let ax = axiom `thy` `ax`;;
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {ax} is not one of its
axioms.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_axiom `ind` `INFINITY_AX`;;
() : void

INFINITY_AX = |- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f

#INFINITY_AX;;
|- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f
}
\USES
Useful for autoloading.

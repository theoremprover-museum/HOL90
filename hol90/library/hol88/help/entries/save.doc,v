\TYPE {Compat.save : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Saves an executable version of HOL in its current state.

\DESCRIBE
The call {save "image"} will save an executable core image, in a file called
{image}, of HOL in its current state. This means that if this image is 
subsequently executed instead of the normal HOL, any bindings set up will be 
preserved.

\FAILURE
Will fail only in system-dependent ways, such as running out of disk space.

\USES
Avoiding the need to re-execute certain initializations, in particular,
installation, every time HOL is run. Note that a {hol-init.sml} file will be
executed automatically every time HOL is run, and is usually sufficient for
private initializations. See the DESCRIPTION for details.

\COMMENTS
Note that a HOL image is rather large; exactly how large depends on the version
of SML and other factors, but it is usually a good many megabytes. 

{save} is not available in hol90; instead, there is {save_hol :string -> unit},
which will preserve certain start-up behaviours of the image (like displaying 
a banner, and loading the hol-init.sml file). Also, most standard ML 
implementations provide a call {exportML} which does exactly what {save} does  in hol88

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC EQ_TAC

\TYPE {EQ_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Reduces goal of equality of boolean terms to forward and backward implication.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, equality, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- t1 = t2}, where {t1} and {t2} have type {bool},
the tactic {EQ_TAC} returns the subgoals {A ?- t1 ==> t2} and
{A ?- t2 ==> t1}.
{
             A ?- t1 = t2
   =================================  EQ_TAC
    A ?- t1 ==> t2   A ?- t2 ==> t1
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the conclusion of the goal is an equation between boolean terms.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

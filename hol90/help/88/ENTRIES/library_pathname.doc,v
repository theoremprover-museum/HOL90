@\DOC library_pathname

\TYPE {library_pathname : (void -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the pathname to the current library directory.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {library_pathname()} returns a string giving the root pathname of
the current library directory.  Usually, this is just the absolute pathname 
to the HOL system library.  But during the evaluation of a call to
{load_library}, the string returned by {library_pathname()} is the library
directory in which the library being loaded resides.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
A very typical application is illustrated by the following code from the
load file for the built-in {string} library:
{
   let path = library_pathname() ^ `/string/` in
       set_search_path (union (search_path()) [path]);;
}
\noindent When the {string} library load file is loaded using {load_library},
this part of the code adds the pathname to the {string} library to the internal
HOL search path.

\USES
The main purpose of the function {library_pathname} is to allow library
load files to update the internal HOL search paths in a site-independent way.

\SEEALSO
install, library_search_path, set_library_search_path.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

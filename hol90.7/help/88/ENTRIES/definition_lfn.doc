\DOC definition_lfn

\TYPE {definition_lfn : (string list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads a given definition from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is an ancestor theory, and {def} one of its definitions, then the
call
{
   definition_lfn [`thy`;`def`]
}
\noindent will return that definition.

\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {def} is not one of its
definitions.

\EXAMPLE
{
#definition_lfn [`bool`; `EXISTS_DEF`];;
|- $? = (\P. P($@ P))
}
\COMMENTS
This call has the same effect as {definition `thy` `def`}.

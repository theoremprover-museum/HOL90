\DOC term_lt

\TYPE {term_lt : term -> term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
A total ordering function on terms.

\DESCRIBE
{term_lt} tells whether one term is less than another in the ordering.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
    - term_lt (--`\x.x = T`--) (--`3 + 4`--)
    val it = false : bool
}

\COMMENTS
If {not (term_lt tm1 tm2)} and {not (term_lt tm2 tm1)}, then {tm1 = tm2}, 
although it is faster to directly test for equality. Ordering of terms may 
be useful in implementing search trees and the like.

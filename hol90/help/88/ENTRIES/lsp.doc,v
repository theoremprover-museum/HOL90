\TYPE {lsp : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks out of top-level ML to Lisp.

\DESCRIBE
{lsp} breaks out of top-level ML to Lisp in such a fashion that one finds
oneself in the particular Lisp's break-level debugger.  ML execution may
be continued safely by issuing the appropriate continuation command to
the Lisp in question.  In Franz, this is a {Control-D}, in Allegro CL it
is {:continue}, in Lucid CL it is {(q)}, and in AKCL it is {:r}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#lsp();;

Break nil
<1>: ^D
[Return to top level]

          Version 1.12 (Sun3/Franz), built on Feb 23 1991

\COMMENTS
{lsp} is not meant for general use, and should be treated with great
care.  If one is not wary, it is entirely possible to corrupt HOL by
using it.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

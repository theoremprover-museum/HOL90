@\DOC RESQ_SPEC

\TYPE {RESQ_SPEC : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a restricted universally quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {u} and a theorem {A |- !x::P. t}, {RESQ_SPEC} returns
the theorem {A, P u |- t[u/x]}. If necessary, variables will be renamed prior
to the specialization to ensure that {u} is free for {x} in {t}, that is,
no variables free in {u} become bound after substitution.
{
      A |- !x::P. t
   ------------------  RESQ_SPEC "u"
    A, P u |- t[u/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not restricted universally quantified,
or if type instantiation fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows how {RESQ_SPEC} renames bound variables if necessary,
prior to substitution: a straightforward substitution would result in the
clearly invalid theorem {(\y. 0 < y)y |- y = y}.
{
   #let th = RESQ_GEN "x:num" "\y.0<y" (REFL "x:num");;
   th = |- !x :: \y. 0 < y. x = x

   #RESQ_SPEC "y:num" th;;
   (\y'. 0 < y')y |- y = y
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

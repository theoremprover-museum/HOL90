@\DOC GEN_ALPHA_CONV

\TYPE {GEN_ALPHA_CONV : (term -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Renames the bound variable of an abstraction, a quantified term, or other
binder application.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, alpha.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {GEN_ALPHA_CONV} provides alpha conversion for lambda
abstractions of the form {"\y.t"}, quantified terms of the forms {"!y.t"},
{"?y.t"} or {"?!y.t"}, and epsilon terms of the form {"@@y.t"}.  In general,
if {B} is a binder constant, then {GEN_ALPHA_CONV} implements alpha
conversion for applications of the form {"B y.t"}.  The function {is_binder}
determines what is regarded as a binder in this context.

If {tm} is an abstraction {"\y.t"} or an application of a binder to
an abstraction {"B y.t"}, where the bound variable {y} has type {":ty"},
and if {"x"} is a variable also of type {:ty}, then {GEN_ALPHA_CONV "x" tm}
returns one of the theorems:
{
   |- (\y.t)  = (\x'. t[x'/y])   
   |- (B y.t)  = (!x'. t[x'/y])
}
\noindent depending on whether the input term is {"\y.t"} or {"B y.t"}
respectively.  The variable {x':ty} in the resulting theorem is a primed
variant of {x} chosen so as not to be free in the term provided as the second
argument to {GEN_ALPHA_CONV}.

\FAILURE
{GEN_ALPHA_CONV x tm} fails if {x} is not a variable, or if {tm} does not have
one of the forms {"\y.t"} or {"B y.t"}, where {B} is a binder (that is,
{is_binder `B`} returns {true}). {GEN_ALPHA_CONV x tm} also fails if {tm}
does have one of these forms, but types of the variables {x} and {y} differ.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

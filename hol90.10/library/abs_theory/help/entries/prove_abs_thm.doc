\TYPE {prove_abs_thm : ((string # term # tactic) -> thm)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a boolean term with abstract components
using the supplied tactic, then save the theorem.

\DESCRIBE 
The function {prove_abs_thm}
is identical to {prove_thm} except that 
the theory obligations for any abstract objects in the goal 
are added to the assumption list before the proof is performed.

\FAILURE Fails if the term is not of type {bool} (and so cannot possibly
be the conclusion of a theorem), or if the tactic cannot solve the goal.
In the latter case {prove_abs_thm} will list the unsolved goals to
help the user.  In addition, {prove_abs_thm} will fail if the theorem
cannot be saved, e.g.  because there is already a theorem of that name in
the current theory segment, or if the resulting theorem has assumptions;
clearly this can only happen if the tactic was invalid, so this gives some
measure of validity checking.

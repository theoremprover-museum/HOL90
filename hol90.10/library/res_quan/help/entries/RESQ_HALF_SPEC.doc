\DOC RESQ_HALF_SPEC

\TYPE {RESQ_HALF_SPEC : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Strip a restricted universal quantification in the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x::P. t}, the derived inference rule
{RESQ_HALF_SPEC} returns
the theorem {A |- !x. P x ==> t}, i.e., it transforms the restricted universal
quantification to its underlying semantic representation.
{
      A |- !x::P. t
   --------------------  RESQ_HALF_SPEC
    A |- !x. P x ==> t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not a restricted universal quantification.

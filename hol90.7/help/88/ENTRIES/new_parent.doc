\TYPE {new_parent : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Extends the current theory with a new parent theory.

\DESCRIBE
Executing {new_parent `thy`} extends the current theory by making the existing
theory named {thy} a parent of the current theory segment. The extended theory
contains the theory segments of both constituent theories. The theory {thy} is
loaded into the system. The message `{Theory thy loaded}' is printed.  The
effect of the call may not be written to the theory file of the segment until
{close_theory} is invoked.  If HOL is quitted before this, the effect may not
persist to future HOL sessions.

\FAILURE
Executing {new_parent `thy`} will fail if the system is not in draft mode. It
will fail if {thy} is not a theory on the current search path. It will fail if
there is a type in theory {thy} with the same name as a type in the current
theory. It will fail if there is a constant in theory {thy} with the same name
as a constant in the current theory. It will fail if an ancestor of theory
{thy} has been extended with either new types or constants which clash with
names in theory {thy}. It will also fail if any of the theory files of theory
{thy} have been damaged. On failure, the system recovers cleanly, unloading any
theory segments it had loaded before the failure was detected.

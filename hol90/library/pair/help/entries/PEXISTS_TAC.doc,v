@\DOC PEXISTS_TAC

\TYPE {PEXISTS_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, quantifier, existential, choose, witness.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Reduces paired existentially quantified goal to one involving a 
specific witness.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {q} and a goal {?p. t}, the tactic
{PEXISTS_TAC} reduces the goal to {t[q/p]}.
{
    A ?- ?p. t
   =============  EXISTS_TAC "q"
    A ?- t[q/p]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is a paired existential quantification
and the term supplied has the same type as the quantified pair in the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The goal:
{
   ?- ?(x,y). (x,y)=(1,2)
}
\noindent can be solved by:
{
   PEXISTS_TAC "(1,2)" THEN REFL_TAC
}
\SEEALSO
EXISTS_TAC, PEXISTS.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

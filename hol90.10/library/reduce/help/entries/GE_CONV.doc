\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are both numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{GE_CONV "m >= n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (m >= n) = T
}
\noindent if the natural number denoted by {m} is greater than or equal to that
denoted by {n}, or
{
   |- (m >= n) = F
}
\noindent otherwise.

\FAILURE
{GE_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form {"m >= n"}, where {m} and {n}
are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#GE_CONV "15 >= 14";;
|- 15 >= 14 = T

#GE_CONV "100 >= 100";;
|- 100 >= 100 = T

#GE_CONV "0 >= 107";;
|- 0 >= 107 = F
}

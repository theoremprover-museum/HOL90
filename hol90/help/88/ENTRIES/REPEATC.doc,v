@\DOC REPEATC

\TYPE {REPEATC : (conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly apply a conversion (zero or more times) until it fails.

\KEYWORDS
conversional.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion effects a transformation of a term {t} to a term {t'},
that is if {c} maps {t} to the theorem {|- t = t`}, then {REPEATC c} is the
conversion that repeats this transformation as often as possible.  More
exactly, if {c} maps the term {"ti"} to {|- ti=t(i+1)} for {i} from {1} to {n},
but fails when applied to the {n+1}th term {"t(n+1)"}, then {REPEATC c "t1"}
returns {|- t1 = t(n+1)}. And if {c "t"} fails, them {REPEATC c "t"} returns
{|- t = t}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but can diverge if the supplied conversion never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

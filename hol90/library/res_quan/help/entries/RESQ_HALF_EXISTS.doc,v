@\DOC RESQ_HALF_EXISTS

\TYPE {RESQ_HALF_EXISTS : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Strip a restricted existential quantification from the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- ?x::P. t}, {RESQ_HALF_EXISTS} returns
the theorem
{
   A |- ?x. P x /\ t
}
\noindent i.e., it transforms the restricted existential
quantification to its underlying semantic representation.
{
      A |- ?x::P. t
   --------------------  RESQ_HALF_EXISTS
    A |- ?x. P x ==> t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not a restricted existential quantification.

\SEEALSO
RESQ_EXISTS_TAC, EXISTS.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {message : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a message to the terminal.

\DESCRIBE
{message s} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the string {s}
to the terminal followed by a carriage return. String quotes are not printed
around the string. The text is queued until the pretty-printer decides where
line breaks are needed, or until the queue is explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#message `This is an example`;;
This is an example
() : void
}
\SEEALSO
print_string, print_tok, print_begin, print_end, print_newline.

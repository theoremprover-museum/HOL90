\TYPE {close_theory : (void -> void)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Finishes a session in draft mode, writing changes to the theory file.
Removes any theory obligations from the theory obligation list.

\DESCRIBE 
Executing {close_theory()} finishes a session in draft mode. It
switches the system to proof mode. Changes made to the current theory
segment are written to the theory file associated with it. For a theory
segment named {`thy`}, the associated file will be {thy.th} in the
directory from which HOL was called. If the theory file does not exist, it
will be created.  Any theory obligations are flushed from the theory
obligation list. If HOL is quit before {close_theory} is invoked, the
additions made to the segment may not persist to future HOL sessions.
While in proof mode, the only changes which may be made to the theory are
the addition of theorems. The theory segment may later be extended with
{extend_theory}.

\FAILURE
A call to {close_theory} will fail if the system is not in draft mode.
Since it involves writing to the file system, if the write fails for
any reason {close_theory} will fail.

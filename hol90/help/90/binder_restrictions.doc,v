@\DOC binder_restrictions

\TYPE {binder_restrictions : unit -> (string * string) list}

\SYNOPSIS
Shows the list of binder restrictions currently in force.

\DESCRIBE
{associate_restriction} is used to control the parsing and prettyprinting of
restricted binders, which give the illusion of dependent types. The list 
of current restrictions is found by calling {binder_restrictions}. There 
are always at least the following restricted binders: ["!","?","@@","\\"].

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
    associate_restriction("DURING","RES_DURING");
    () : unit

    binder_restrictions();
    [("DURING","RES_DURING"),("!","RES_FORALL"),("?","RES_EXISTS"),
     ("@@","RES_SELECT"),("\\","RES_ABSTRACT")] : (string * string) list

}
\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC ALPHA_CONV

\TYPE {ALPHA_CONV : (term -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Renames the bound variable of a lambda-abstraction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, alpha.

\DESCRIBE
If {x} is a variable of type {ty} and {M} is an abstraction (with
bound variable {y} of type {ty} and body {t}), then {ALPHA_CONV x M}
returns the theorem:
{
   |- (\y.t) = (\x'. t[x'/y])
}
\noindent where the variable {x':ty} is a primed variant of {x} chosen so
as not to be free in {\y.t}.

\FAILURE
{ALPHA_CONV x tm} fails if {x} is not a variable, if {tm} is not an
abstraction, or if {x} is a variable {v} and {tm} is a lambda abstraction
{\y.t} but the types of {v} and {y} differ.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

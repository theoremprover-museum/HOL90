@\DOC ONCE_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {ONCE_REWRITE_CONV : (thm list -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a term, including built-in tautologies in the list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
{ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} searches for matching subterms and applies
rewrites once at each subterm, in the manner specified for
{ONCE_DEPTH_CONV}. The rewrites which are used are obtained from the
given list of theorems and the set of tautologies stored in
{basic_rewrites}. See {GEN_REWRITE_CONV} for the general method of
using theorems to rewrite a term.

\FAILURE
{ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} does not fail; it does not diverge.

\USES
{ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} can be used to rewrite a term when recursive
rewriting is not desired.

\SEEALSO
GEN_REWRITE_CONV, PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV, PURE_REWRITE_CONV, REWRITE_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

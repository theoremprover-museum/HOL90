\DOC set_pretty_mode

\TYPE {set_pretty_mode : (bool -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Initializes the pretty-printer.

\DESCRIBE
{set_pretty_mode true} causes all remaining text in the print queue to be
printed, and then the pretty-printer is reinitialized.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
{set_pretty_mode false} should turn the pretty-printer off after printing all
text in the queue, but the current implementation does not do this.

\SEEALSO
print_begin, print_end, print_newline.

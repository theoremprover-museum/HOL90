@\DOC VALID

\TYPE {VALID : (tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tries to ensure that a tactic is valid.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
For any tactic {T}, the application {VALID T} gives a new tactic which when
applied to a goal, checks that {T} as applied to that goal is valid, i.e. the
subgoals produced, if proved, can be used by the justification function given
by {T} to construct a theorem corresponding to the original goal.

This check is performed by actually creating, using {mk_thm}, theorems
corresponding to the subgoals, and seeing if the result of applying the
justification function to them gives a theorem corresponding to the original
goal. If it does, then {VALID T} simply applies {T}, and if not it fails.

The method by which theorems are created from goals can be changed by rebinding
the assignable variable {chktac} - see its documentation entry for details.

\FAILURE
The application of {VALID} to a tactic never fails. The resulting
tactic fails either if the original tactic fails or is invalid.

\COMMENTS
The use of {mk_thm} is a possible, though improbable, loophole
in the general security of the theorem abstract type, since it does
create possibly spurious theorems; however these should remain anonymous
in the absence of other bugs in the system.

By default the same validity checking procedure, {check_valid}, is
invoked by the subgoal package, but it can be switched off.

It is not checked whether the tactic is strongly valid, i.e. the
subgoals are provable; clearly this is not possible in general.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

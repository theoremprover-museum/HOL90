@\DOC load_theorem

\TYPE {load_theorem : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in a given theorem from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, and {th} one of its axioms, then
{
   load_theorem `thy` `th`
}
\noindent will attempt to load the corresponding theorem, that is, to perform
dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let th = theorem `thy` `th`;;
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {th} is not one of its
theorems.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_theorem `bool` `PAIR`;;
() : void

PAIR = |- !x. FST x,SND x = x

#PAIR;;
|- !x. FST x,SND x = x
}
\USES
Useful for autoloading.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

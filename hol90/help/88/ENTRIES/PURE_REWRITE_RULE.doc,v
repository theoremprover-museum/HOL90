@\DOC PURE_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
This rule provides a method for rewriting a theorem with the theorems given,
and excluding simplification with tautologies in {basic_rewrites}. Matching
subterms are found recursively starting from the term in the conclusion part of
the theorem, until no more matches are found. For more details on rewriting see
{GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\USES
{PURE_REWRITE_RULE} is useful when the simplifications that arise by
rewriting a theorem with {basic_rewrites} are not wanted.

\FAILURE
Does not fail. May result in divergence, in which case
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_RULE} can be used.

\SEEALSO

PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE, PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE,

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC DEF_EXISTS_RULE

\TYPE {DEF_EXISTS_RULE : (term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves that a function defined by a definitional equation exists.

\KEYWORDS
rule, definition.

\DESCRIBE
This rule accepts a term of the form {"c = ..."} or {"f x1 ... xn = ..."}, the
variables of which may be universally quantified, and returns an existential
theorem. The resulting theorem is typically used for generating HOL
specifications.

\FAILURE
{DEF_EXISTS_RULE} fails if the definition is not an equation, if there
is any variable in the right-hand side which does not occur in the
left-hand side, if the definition is recursive, if there is a free type
variable, or if the name being defined by the function is not allowed.

\EXAMPLE
The effect of this rule can be understood more clearly through an
example:
{
   #DEF_EXISTS_RULE "max a b = ((a < b) => b | a)" ;;
   |- ?max. !a b. max a b = (a < b => b | a)
}
\COMMENTS
In later versions of HOL this function may be made internal.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

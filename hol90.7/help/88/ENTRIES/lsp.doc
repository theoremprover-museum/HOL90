\TYPE {lsp : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks out of top-level ML to Lisp.

\DESCRIBE
{lsp} breaks out of top-level ML to Lisp in such a fashion that one finds
oneself in the particular Lisp's break-level debugger.  ML execution may
be continued safely by issuing the appropriate continuation command to
the Lisp in question.  In Franz, this is a {Control-D}, in Allegro CL it
is {:continue}, in Lucid CL it is {(q)}, and in AKCL it is {:r}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#lsp();;

Break nil
<1>: ^D
[Return to top level]

\COMMENTS
{lsp} is not meant for general use, and should be treated with great
care.  If one is not wary, it is entirely possible to corrupt HOL by
using it.

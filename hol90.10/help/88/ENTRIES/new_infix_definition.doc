\TYPE {new_infix_definition : ((string # term) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new infix constant and installs a definitional axiom in the current
theory.

\DESCRIBE
The function {new_infix_definition} provides a facility for definitional
extensions to the current theory.  It takes a pair argument consisting
of the name under which the resulting definition will be saved
in the current theory segment, and a term giving the desired definition.  The
value returned by {new_infix_definition} is a theorem which states the
definition requested by the user.

Let {v_1} and {v_2} be tuples of distinct variables, containing the variables
{x_1,...,x_m}.  Evaluating {new_infix_definition (`name`, "ix v_1 v_2 = t")},
where {ix} is not already a constant, declares the sequent {({{}},"\v_1 v_2.
t")} to be a definition in the current theory, and declares {ix} to be
a new constant in the current theory with this definition as its specification.
This constant specification is returned as a theorem with the form
{
   |- !x_1 ... x_m. v_1 ix v_2 = t
}
\noindent and is saved in the current theory under
(the name) {name}.  Optionally, the definitional term argument
may have any of its variables universally quantified.
The constant {ix} has infix status only after the infix
declaration has been processed.  It is therefore necessary to use
the constant in normal prefix position when making the definition.

\FAILURE
{new_infix_definition} fails if called when HOL is not in draft mode.  It also
fails if there is already an axiom, definition or specification of the given
name in the current theory segment; if {`ix`} is already a constant in the
current theory or is not an allowed name for a constant; if {t} contains free
variables that are not in either of the variable structures {v_1} and {v_2}
(this is equivalent to requiring {\v_1 v_2. t} to be a closed term); or if any
variable occurs more than once in {v_1, v_2}.  Failure also occurs if the type
of {ix} is not of the form {:ty_1->ty_2->ty_3}.  Finally, failure occurs if
there is a type variable in {v_1}, ..., {v_n} or {t} that does not occur in the
type of {ix}.

\EXAMPLE
The nand function can be defined as follows.
{
   #new_infix_definition
    (`nand`, "$nand in_1 in_2 = ~(in_1 /\ in_2)");;
   |- !in_1 in_2. in_1 nand in_2 = ~(in_1 /\ in_2)
}
\COMMENTS
It is a common practice among HOL users to write a {$} before
the constant being defined as an infix to indicate that after the
definition is made, it will have a special syntactic status; ie. to
write:
{
   new_infix_definition(`ix_DEF`, "$ix m n = ... ")
}
\noindent This use of {$} is not necessary; but after the definition
has been made {$} must, of course, be used if the syntactic status
needs to be suppressed.

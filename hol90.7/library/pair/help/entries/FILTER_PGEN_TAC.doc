\TYPE {FILTER_PGEN_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, selective, quantifier, universal.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Strips off a paired universal quantifier,
but fails for a given quantified pair.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {q} and a goal {A ?- !p. t},
the tactic {FILTER_PGEN_TAC} fails if the quantified pair {p} is the same as
{p}, but otherwise advances the goal in the same way as {PGEN_TAC},
i.e. returns the goal {A ?- t[p'/p]} where {p'} is a variant of {p} chosen to
avoid clashing with any variables free in the goal's assumption list.
Normally {p'} is just {p}.

}
\FAILURE
Fails if the goal's conclusion is not a paired universal quantifier or the
quantified pair is equal to the given term.

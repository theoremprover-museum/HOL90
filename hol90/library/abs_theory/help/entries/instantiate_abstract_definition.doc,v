@\DOC instantiate_abstract_definition

\TYPE {instantiate_abstract_definition : string -> string -> thm -> (term # term) list -> thm}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS 
Instantiates a definition that is made in terms of a definition
from an abstract theory.

\DESCRIBE 
A call of {instantiate_abstract_definition `thy` `th` def
tpl} retrieves the abstract definition {th} from the abstract theory
{thy} rewrites {def} with it and instantiates the result using
{tpl}, where {tpl} is a list of paired terms where the first term is
the variable to be instantiated and the second term is the instantiation.
The abstract theory {thy} must be an ancestor of the current theory.

\FAILURE 
The call will fail if the theory {thy} is not an ancestor of the
current theory.  It will fail if there does not exist a definition {th}
in theory segment {thy}.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

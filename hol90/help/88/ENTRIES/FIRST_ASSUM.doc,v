@\DOC FIRST_ASSUM

\TYPE {FIRST_ASSUM : (thm_tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps a theorem-tactic over the assumptions, applying first successful tactic.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic
{
   FIRST_ASSUM ttac ([A1; ...; An], g)
}
\noindent has the effect of applying the first tactic which can be produced by
{ttac} from the {ASSUME}d assumptions {(A1 |- A1)}, ..., {(An |- An)} and which
succeeds when applied to the goal. Failures of {ttac} to produce a tactic are
ignored.

\FAILURE
Fails if {ttac (Ai |- Ai)} fails for every assumption {Ai}, or if the
assumption list is empty, or if all the tactics produced by {ttac} fail when
applied to the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The tactic
{
   FIRST_ASSUM (\asm. CONTR_TAC asm  ORELSE  ACCEPT_TAC asm)
}
\noindent searches the assumptions for either a contradiction or the desired
conclusion. The tactic
{
   FIRST_ASSUM MATCH_MP_TAC
}
\noindent searches the assumption list for an implication whose conclusion
matches the goal, reducing the goal to the antecedent of the corresponding
instance of this implication.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

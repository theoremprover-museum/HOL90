\DOC print_goal

\TYPE {print_goal : (goal -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a goal, including its assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
The function {print_goal} takes a goal as argument and prints the goal
and its list of assumptions.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
If we define a goal in the following manner:
{
   #let goal = ([],"!a. a /\ T ==> a");;
   goal = ([], "!a. a /\ T ==> a") : (* list # term)

}
\noindent and then do:
{
   #print_goal goal;;
}
\noindent The system responds with:
{
   "!a. a /\ T ==> a"

   () : void
}
\noindent If there were assumptions these would also have been printed.

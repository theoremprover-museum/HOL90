\TYPE {hyp_union : (thm list -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns union of assumption lists of the given theorems.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of theorems, {hyp_union} returns the union (see
{union}) of their assumption lists. Straight repetitions only arise if there
were multiple instances of an assumption in a single assumption list. There is
no elimination of alpha-equivalent pairs of assumptions, only ones which are
actually equal.

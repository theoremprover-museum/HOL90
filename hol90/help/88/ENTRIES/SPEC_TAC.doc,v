@\DOC SPEC_TAC

\TYPE {SPEC_TAC : ((term # term) -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {(u,x)}, where {x} is just a variable,
and a goal {A ?- t}, the tactic {SPEC_TAC} generalizes the goal to
{A ?- !x. t[x/u]}, that is, all instances of {u} are turned into {x}.
{
        A ?- t
   =================  SPEC_TAC ("u","x")
    A ?- !x. t[x/u]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless {x} is a variable with the same type as {u}.

\USES
Removing unnecessary speciality in a goal, particularly as a prelude to
an inductive proof.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

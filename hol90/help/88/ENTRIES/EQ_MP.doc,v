@\DOC EQ_MP

\TYPE {EQ_MP : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Equality version of the Modus Ponens rule.

\KEYWORDS
rule, equality, modus, ponens.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- t1 = t2} and {A2 |- t1}, the inference
rule {EQ_MP} returns the theorem {A1 u A2 |- t2}.
{
    A1 |- t1 = t2   A2 |- t1
   --------------------------  EQ_MP
         A1 u A2 |- t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the first theorem is equational and its left side
is the same as the conclusion of the second theorem (and is therefore
of type {bool}), up to alpha-conversion.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

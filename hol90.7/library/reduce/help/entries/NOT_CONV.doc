\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} corresponds to one of the forms given below, where {t} is an arbitrary
term of type {bool}, then {NOT_CONV tm} returns the corresponding theorem.
{
   NOT_CONV "~F"  = |-  ~F = T
   NOT_CONV "~T"  = |-  ~T = F
   NOT_CONV "~~t" = |- ~~t = t
}

\FAILURE
{NOT_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has one of the forms indicated above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#NOT_CONV "~~~~T";;
|- ~~~~T = ~~T

#NOT_CONV "~~T";;
|- ~~T = T

#NOT_CONV "~T";;
|- ~T = F
}

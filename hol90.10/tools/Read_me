This directory is for the odds and ends attached to hol90.

Contents.

doc-to-help.sed   - the hol90 "help" function uses this to format its output.
                    Taken from the hol88 release.

howto.yak         - a short and simple introduction to ML-Yacc

ml-conv.el        - a small set of gnu_emacs lisp functions for the rough 
                    conversion of ML Classic to SML. Works best on files 
                    consisting mainly of proofs. If you can make any 
                    improvements, send them to slind@informatik.tu-muenchen.de

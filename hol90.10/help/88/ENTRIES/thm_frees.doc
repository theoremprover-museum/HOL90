\DOC thm_frees

\TYPE {thm_frees : (thm -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the variables free in a theorem's assumptions and conclusion.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem, {A |- t}, the function {thm_frees} returns a list,
without repetitions, of those variables which are free either in {t} or in
some member of the assumption list {A}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
When applied to the following theorem:
{
   (SUC m) < (SUC n) |- m < n
}
\noindent {thm_frees} returns the list {["m"; "n"]}. The term {SUC} is a
constant, not a variable, so that is not included.

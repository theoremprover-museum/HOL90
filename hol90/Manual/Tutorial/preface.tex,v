@\chapter*{Preface}\markboth{Preface}{Preface}
\label{intro}

This volume contains a tutorial on the \HOL\ system.  It is one of three
documents making up the documentation for \HOL:

\begin{myenumerate}
\item \TUTORIAL: a tutorial introduction to \HOL.
\item \DESCRIPTION: a description of higher order logic,
the \ML\ programming language, and theorem proving methods in the \HOL\ system;
\item \REFERENCE: the reference documentation of the tools available in \HOL.
\end{myenumerate}

\noindent These three documents will be referred to by the short names (in
small slanted capitals) given above.

This document, \TUTORIAL, is intended to be the first item read by new users of
\HOL.  It provides a self-study introduction to the structure and use of the
system.  The tutorial is intended to give a `hands-on' feel for the way \HOL\
is used, but it does not systematically explain all the underlying principles
(\DESCRIPTION, explains these).  After working through \TUTORIAL\ the reader
should be capable of using \HOL\ for simple tasks, and should also be in a
position to consult the other two documents.

\section*{Getting started}

Chapter~\ref{install} explains how to get and install \HOL.  Once this is done,
the potential \HOL\ user should become familiar with the following subjects:

\begin{enumerate}
\item The programming meta-language \ML, and how to interact
with it through an editor.
\item The formal logic supported by 
the \HOL\ system (higher order logic) and its manipulation via \ML.
\item Forward proof and derived rules of inference.
\item Goal directed proof, tactics and tacticals.
\end{enumerate}

Chapters 1--5 introduce these topics. The remaining three chapters
contain examples of complete pieces of work.
\begin{itemize}
\item Chapter~\ref{parity}
consists of a worked example: the specification and
verification of a simple sequential parity checker.  The intention is
to   accomplish two things:
(i) to present a complete piece of work with \HOL; and
(ii) to give an idea of what it is like to use the \HOL\
system for a tricky proof.  

\item Chapter~\ref{tool} shows how a special purpose proof tool (a conjunction
normaliser) can be implemented and optimised. It illustrates methods for
`tuning' proof generating programs and discusses trade-offs between generality
and efficiency.

\item Chapter~\ref{binomial} is a proof of the Binomial Theorem in a ring.  It
is a medium sized worked example whose subject matter is probably more widely
known than any specific piece of hardware or software. The small amount of
algebra and mathematical notation needed to state and prove the Binomial
Theorem is presented; the notation is expressed in \HOL{}, and the
structure of the proof is outlined.

\end{itemize}

\noindent \TUTORIAL\ has been kept short so that new users of \HOL\ can get
going as fast as possible. Sometimes details have been simplified. It is
recommended that as soon as a topic in \TUTORIAL\ has been digested, the
relevant bits of \DESCRIPTION\ and \REFERENCE\ be studied.

\section*{Exercises}

The directory:

\begin{hol}\begin{verbatim}
   hol/Training/exercises
\end{verbatim}\end{hol}

\noindent contains exercises (with solutions) in the use of \HOL. It is
recommended that these exercises be studied in conjunction with reading
\TUTORIAL\ and \DESCRIPTION.

\section*{Courseware}

The  directory:

\begin{hol}\begin{verbatim}
   hol/Training/course
\end{verbatim}\end{hol}

\noindent contains the \LaTeX\ sources for an intensive course on \HOL\
developed by Tom Melham. These are intended to be a resource for anyone who
wishes to teach \HOL.

\section*{Case studies}

The previous version of \TUTORIAL\ contained a number of advanced case
studies. These are now separate documents in the directory:

\begin{hol}\begin{verbatim}
   hol/Training/studies
\end{verbatim}\end{hol}

\noindent The case studies in this directory are:

\begin{enumerate}
\item {\tt microprocessor}:  the specification and verification of a simple
microprocessor, due to Jeff Joyce ({\verb+joyce@@cs.ubc.ca+}).
This case study illustrates the
state-of-the-art in an already mature area. Several new techniques are
illustrated, including the use of temporal logic embedded in \HOL\ for
reasoning about asynchronous processes.
\item {\tt protocols}: the specification and verification of a sliding window
protocol, due to Rachel Cardell-Oliver ({\verb+rco@@cam.sri.com+}).
This case study shows a new and
rapidly evolving application of the \HOL\ system that is currently an
active area of research at Cambridge. There have been significant developments 
in this field since this study was written.
\item {\tt int\_mod}: modular arithmetic of integers
developed as an application of the group
theory library, due to Elsa Gunter ({\verb+elsa@@research.att.com+}).
This case study
is a comprehensive
tutorial on how one might conduct mathematical proof in type theory.
It shows how to apply the abstract group theory library, which she
wrote, to the development of a particular mathematical theory (modular
arithmetic).  Her paper {\sl Doing Algebra in Simple Type Theory} is
included with the case study for the reader's convenience (it is also
to be published elsewhere).
\end{enumerate}

The case studies use different styles of proof in \HOL, different ways of
laying out \ML\ code, etc. These reflect the differing aesthetic tastes and
backgrounds of the authors. It is not intended that any of the styles is to be
considered `standard'.  There may eventually emerge a `Manual of Proof Style
for \HOL', but it would be premature to try to write one now. It is a
considerable virtue of Milner's \LCF\ approach to theorem proving that it so
smoothly accommodates such a wide variety of styles, and yet maintains complete
logical security.

The reader is warned that the case studies were developed for \HOL 88 Version
1.10 and it is possible that they will need to be modified to run in later
versions of \HOL.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

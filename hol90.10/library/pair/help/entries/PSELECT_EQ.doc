\TYPE {PSELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon, equality.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a theorem
whose conclusion is equational:
{
    A |- t1 = t2
}
the inference rule {PSELECT_EQ} returns the theorem:
{
    A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)
}
provided no variable in {p} is free in the assumptions.
{
         A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------------  SELECT_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
    A |- (@p. t1) = (@p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation, 
of if {p} is not a paired structure of variables, 
or if any variable in {p} is free in {A}.

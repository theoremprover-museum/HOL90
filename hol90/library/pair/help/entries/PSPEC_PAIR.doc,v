@\DOC PSPEC_PAIR

\TYPE {PSPEC_PAIR : (thm -> (term # thm))}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem, returning the chosen variant.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t}, the inference rule {PSPEC_PAIR}
returns the term {q'} and the theorem {A |- t[q'/p]}, where {q'} is a variant
of {p} chosen to avoid free variable capture.
{
     A |- !p. t
   --------------  PSPEC_PAIR
    A |- t[q'/q]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem's conclusion is a paired universal quantification.

\COMMENTS
This rule is very similar to plain {PSPEC}, except that it returns the
variant chosen, which may be useful information under some circumstances.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

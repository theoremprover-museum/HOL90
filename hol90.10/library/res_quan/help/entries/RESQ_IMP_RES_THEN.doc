\DOC RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN

\TYPE {RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Resolves a restricted universally quantified theorem with
the assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, resolution, restricted quantification.

\DESCRIBE
The function {RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN} is the basic building block for
resolution using a restricted quantified theorem.
It takes a restricted quantified theorem and transforms it into an
implication. This resulting theorem is used in the resolution.

Given a theorem-tactic {ttac} and a theorem {th}, the theorem-tactical
{RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN} transforms the theorem into an implication {th'}. It
then passes {th'} together with {ttac} to {IMP_RES_THEN} to carry out
the resolution.

\FAILURE
Evaluating {RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN ttac th} fails if the supplied
theorem {th} is not restricted universally quantified, or if the call
to {IMP_RES_THEN} fails.

\TYPE {hyp_thms : (window -> thm list)}

\SYNOPSIS
The theorems infered from the context of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{hyp_thms w} is the list of theorems which are infered from the
context of {w}.  The conclusions of these theorems are the
hypotheses of the window.

\EXAMPLE
{
- BEGIN_STACK "hyp-ex" (--`($=) ((A /\ B) /\ C)`--) [] [];

= * (A /\ B) /\ C
val it = () : unit
- DO (OPEN_WIN [RAND]);

  ! B
  ! A
= * C
val it = () : unit
- hyp_thms (top_window (CURRENT_STACK ()));
val it = [[A /\ B] |- A,[A /\ B] |- B] : thm list
}

\FAILURE
Never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

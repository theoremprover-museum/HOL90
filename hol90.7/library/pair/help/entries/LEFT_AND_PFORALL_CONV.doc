\DOC LEFT_AND_PFORALL_CONV

\TYPE {LEFT_AND_PFORALL_CONV : conv}

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification of the left conjunct outwards through
a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(!p. t) /\ u}, the conversion
{LEFT_AND_PFORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (!p. t) /\ u = (!p'. t[p'/p] /\ u)
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of {p} that does not appear free in
the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {(!p. t) /\ u}.

@\DOC PWORDLEN_CONV

\TYPE {PWORDLEN_CONV : term list -> conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, word.

\LIBRARY word

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the predicate asserting the size of a word.

\DESCRIBE
For any term {tm} of type {:(*)word}, the result of evaluating
{
   PWORDLEN_CONV tms "PWORDLEN n tm"
}
\noindent where {n} must be a numeric constant,
is the theorem
{
   A |- PWORDLEN n tm = T
}
\noindent where the new assumption(s) {A} depends on the actual form
of the term {tm}.

If {tm} is an application of the unary bitwise operator {WNOT}, i.e.,
{tm = WNOT tm'}, then {A} will be {PWORDLEN n tm'}.
If {tm} is an application of one of the binary bitwise operators:
{WAND}, {WOR} and {WXOR}, then {A} will be {PWORDLEN n tm'}, {PWORDLEN n tm''}.
If {tm} is  {WORD [b(n-1);...;b0]}, then {A} is empty. The length of
the list must agree with {n}.
In all above cases, the term list argument is irrelevant. An empty
list could be supplied.

If {tm} is {WSEG n k tm'}, then the term list {tms} should  be {[N]}
which indicates the size of {tm'},
and the assumption {A} will be {PWORDLEN N tm'}.

If {tm} is {WCAT(tm',tm'')}, then the term list {tms} should be
{[n1;n2]} which tells the sizes of the words to be concatenated. The
assumption will be {PWORDLEN n1 tm', PWORDLEN n2 tm''}. The value of
{n} must be the sum of {n1} and {n2}.

\FAILURE
{PWORDLEN_CONV tms tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

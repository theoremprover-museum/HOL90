\chapter{The {\tt word} library}

Bit vector (or word)\footnote{The two terms, {\it bit vector\/} and
{\it word\/} will be used interchangeably in this manual.}  is one of
the fundamental data objects in hardware  
specification and verification. The modelling of bit vectors is a
key to the success of a hardware verification project. This library
attempt to provide a general, flexible infrastructure for reasoning about
words. The description begins with a discussion of approach used
by the library to model words. This is followed by a summary of the
facilities available in the library. Chapter~2 contains the reference
entries of all \ML\ functions, and the last chapter lists all theorems
stored in the library.

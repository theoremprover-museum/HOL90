@\DOC OPEN_WIN

\TYPE {OPEN_WIN : (path -> win_stack -> win_stack)}

\SYNOPSIS
Open a subwindow on the focus of the top window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{OPEN_WIN path s} opens a subwindow in the focus of the top window of
the stack {s} at the position described by {path}. The subwindow is
then pushed onto the top of the window stack.

\FAILURE
{OPEN_WIN path s} will fail if {path} describes a position which
is not present in the focus of the top window of {s}.

\EXAMPLE
{
- BEGIN_STACK "example" (--`($<==) (A /\ (B /\ F))`--) [] []; 

<== * A /\ B /\ F
val it = () : unit
- DO (OPEN_WIN [RAND]);

    ! A
<== * B /\ F
val it = () : unit
- DO (REWRITE_WIN []);

    ! A
<== * F
val it = () : unit
- DO CLOSE_WIN;

<== * A /\ F
val it = () : unit
- END_STACK "example";
val it = () : unit
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib

   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC X_LIST_CONV

\TYPE {X_LIST_CONV: {{Aux_thms: thm list, Fold_thms: thm list}} -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves theorems about list constants applied to {NIL}, {CONS}, {SNOC},
{APPEND}, {FLAT} and {REVERSE}. Auxiliary information can be passed as an
argument.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, list.

\DESCRIBE
{X_LIST_CONV} is a version of {LIST_CONV} which can be passed auxiliary
theorems about user-defined constants as an argument. It takes a term of the
form:
{
   CONST1 ... (CONST2 ...) ...                                       
}                                                                         
\noindent where {CONST1} and {CONST2} are operators on lists and {CONST2} returns a list    
result. It can be one of {NIL}, {CONS}, {SNOC}, {APPEND}, {FLAT} or {REVERSE}.
The form of the resulting theorem depends on {CONST1} and {CONST2}. Some
auxiliary information must be provided about {CONST1}. {X_LIST_CONV} maintains a
database of such auxiliary information. It initially holds information about
the constants in the system. However, additional information can be supplied
by the user as new constants are defined. The main information that is needed
is a theorem defining the constant in terms of {FOLDR} or {FOLDL}. The
definition should have the form:
{
   |- CONST1 ...l... = fold f e l
}
\noindent where {fold} is either {FOLDR} or {FOLDL}, {f} is a function, {e} a base
element and {l} a list variable. For example, a suitable theorem for {SUM} is
{
   |- SUM l = FOLDR $+ 0 l
}
\noindent Knowing this theorem and given the term {--`SUM (CONS x l)`--},
{X_LIST_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- SUM (CONS x l) = x + (SUM l)
}
\noindent Other auxiliary theorems that are needed concern the terms {f} and
{e} found in the definition with respect to {FOLDR} or {FOLDL}. For example,
knowing the theorem:
{
   |- MONOID $+ 0
}
\noindent and given the term {--`SUM (APPEND l1 l2)`--}, {X_LIST_CONV} returns
the theorem
{
   |- SUM (APPEND l1 l2) = (SUM l1) + (SUM l2)
}
\noindent The following table shows the form of the theorem returned and the
auxiliary theorems needed if {CONST1} is defined in terms of {FOLDR}.

\noindent {|- MONOID f e} can be used  instead of {|- FCOMM f f},
{|- LEFT_ID f} or {|- RIGHT_ID f}. {|- ASSOC f} can also be used in place of
{|- FCOMM f f}.                                                              



Auxiliary theorems are held in a user-updatable database. In particular,
definitions of constants in terms of {FOLDR} and {FOLDL}, and monoid,
commutativity, associativity, left identity, right identity and binary
function commutativity theorems are stored. The database can be updated by the
user to allow {LIST_CONV} to prove theorems about new constants. This is done
by calling {set_list_thm_database}. The database can be inspected by calling
{list_thm_database}. The database initially holds {FOLDR/L} theorems for the
following system constants: {APPEND}, {FLAT}, {LENGTH}, {NULL}, {REVERSE},
{MAP}, {FILTER}, {ALL_EL}, {SUM}, {SOME_EL}, {IS_EL}, {AND_EL}, {OR_EL},
{PREFIX}, {SUFFIX}, {SNOC} and {FLAT} combined with {REVERSE}. It also holds
auxiliary theorems about their step functions and base elements.  Rather than
updating the database, additional theorems can be passed to {X_LIST_CONV} as
an argument. It takes a record with one field, {Fold_thms}, for fold
definitions, and one, {Aux_thms}, for theorems about step functions and base
elements.

\EXAMPLE
{
- val MULTL = new_definition("MULTL",(--`MULTL l = FOLDR $* 1 l`--));
val MULTL = |- !l. MULTL l = FOLDR $* 1 l : thm

- X_LIST_CONV {{Fold_thms = MULTL, Aux_thms = []}} (--`MULTL (CONS x l)`--);
|- MULTL (CONS x l) = x * MULTL l
}

\FAILURE

{X_LIST_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above. It fails if
no fold definition for {CONST1} are either in the database or passed as an
argument. It also fails if the required auxiliary theorems, as described
above, are not held in the databases or passed aas an argument.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

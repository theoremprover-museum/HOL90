@\DOC is_letter

\TYPE {is_letter : (string -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests whether a character is a letter.

\DESCRIBE
When given a string, which should be of length 1, {is_letter} returns
{true} iff the character is a letter. By default this means what one
would expect, namely one of {a..z A..Z}. However the scope of the
definition can be increased using {new_letter}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the string has length greater than 1. Returns {false} for the
null string ({``}).

\SEEALSO
ascii, ascii_code, is_alphanum, new_alphanum, new_letter.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

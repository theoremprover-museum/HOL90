\TYPE {merge : (('a -> 'a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Merges two sorted lists according to a given ordering relation.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{merge r l1 l2} merges the two sorted lists {l1} and {l2} to produce
one sorted list containing the the elements of both {l1} and {l2}.
This function will not work if {l1} and {l2} are not sorted according
to {r}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
- merge (fn a => fn b => b >= a) [1,3,5,7,9] [2,4,6,8,10];
val it = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10] : int list
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

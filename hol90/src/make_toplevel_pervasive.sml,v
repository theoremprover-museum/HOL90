1.1
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

1.1.2.1
log
@Theory files now build with SML/NJ 109, SML/NJ 108.5 (using CM), SML/NJ 0.93,
and Poly/ML 3.0.
The quotation filter has been modified so that antiquotation works correctly
in old-style quotations.
The quotation filter is now compiled using flex and gcc (by default).
The arguments to the script for running hol90 have been changed.

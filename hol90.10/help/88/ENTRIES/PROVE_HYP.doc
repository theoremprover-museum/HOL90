\DOC PROVE_HYP

\TYPE {PROVE_HYP : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates a provable assumption from a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, assumption.

\DESCRIBE

When applied to two theorems, {PROVE_HYP} returns a theorem having the
conclusion of the second. The new hypotheses are the union of the
two hypothesis sets (first deleting, however, the conclusion of the
first theorem from the hypotheses of the second).

{
     A1 |- t1     A2 |- t2
   ------------------------  PROVE_HYP
    A1 u (A2 - {{t1}}) |- t2
}

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
This is the Cut rule. It is not necessary for the conclusion of the first
theorem to be the same as an assumption of the second, but {PROVE_HYP} is
otherwise of doubtful value.

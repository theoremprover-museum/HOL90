\DOC print_all_thm

\TYPE {print_all_thm : (thm -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a theorem in full.

\DESCRIBE
The function {print_all_thm} will cause the system to print a
theorem with its hypotheses.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
As a simple example of the use of {print_all_thm} we assume the
following two theorems:
{
   #let a = ASSUME "A:bool";;
   a = . |- A
}
{
   #let b = ASSUME "A ==> B";;
   b = . |- A ==> B
}
\noindent Using Modus Ponens (MP) as follows:
{
   #let r = MP b a;;
}
\noindent The system responds with:
{
   r = .. |- B
}
\noindent By using {print_all_thm} as follows:
{
   #print_all_thm r;;
}
\noindent The system then pretty prints:
{
   A ==> B, A |- B() : void
}
\noindent This shows all the assumptions of the theorem in a comma separated
list.

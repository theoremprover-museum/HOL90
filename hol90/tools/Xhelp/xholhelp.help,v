                  INTERFACE TO HOL88/90 DOCUMENTATION

The program xholhelp provides an X-based interface to documentation
for the HOL system. Three types of access are available: 

Apropos:   produces a short listing of all HOL entities (NOT THEOREMS)
           whose name contains the substring currently in the dialog 
           box. The string may contain wildcards, as in ASM*TAC.

Reference: the full help entry will be produced. The string in the
           dialog box must correspond exactly to the name of a 
           documented function.

Theorems:  the string in the dialog box is used to access all theorems 
           documented whose name contains the given substring.

These functions are accessed by typing in a string and then pressing
the appropriate button. Also, pressing the RETURN key causes the
"apropos" information to be output. The ESCAPE key can be used to
obtain full references, and TAB to examine theorem documentation.


ACCELERATORS

The keyboard inputs can be entered anywhere in the main window. Also:

  Ctrl-V (or Ctrl-N)   forward scrolling
  Meta-V (or Ctrl-P)   backward strolling
  Ctrl-L               clears dialog box
  Ctrl-Q               quits xholhelp

  <Return>             invokes apropos
  <Escape>             invokes reference
  <Tab>                invokes theorems


PATH CUSTOMIZATION

The "pathedit" button allows the user to augment or alter the help
path (prefixing, not overriding the programmed defaults, nor the
values of any environment variables set.) Copy and paste into this
popup dialog box from the window in which hol is running when hol
loads some new help files, libraries, etc. There is a similar popup
under the "theorems" button if you click with the RIGHT MOUSE. For the
popup boxes:

 [button] OK           commits change, if any
 [button] Cancel       cancels the command/edit

Hitting <Return> in the popup dialog boxes is equivalent to OK.


ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

Documentation entries can be searched for in any directory, depending
on two shell variables: HOL_HELP_PATH and THM_HELP_PATH. For example,
to access documentation on the string library, as well as
documentation on other tactics in personal space, use:

setenv HOL_HELP_PATH $HOLDIR/Library/string/help/entries:$HOME/tactics

or

export HOL_HELP_PATH=$HOLDIR/Library/string/help/entries:$HOME/tactics

depending on your shell. (Each directory in the path must be separated
by ":", just like in the Unix search PATH.)

These paths will be added to default paths, so the program will work
even if these variables are not set.


FAST-PRINTING DOCUMENTATION

The current documentation in the text box can be sent to a printer, or
any process which accepts input through a pipe. The environment
variable HOL_PRINT_CMD must be set appropriately, as in:

setenv HOL_PRINT_CMD "lpr -Plw5"

Motto: Save trees, that's why we provided on-line help!

SHELL INTERFACE

The three functions can also be accessed directly from a Unix shell.
The names of the three commands are: "hol_apro", "hol_ref", and
"hol_thm", which are located in the same directory as the "xholhelp"
program. (E.g., just type "hol_apro ASM*TAC" at the shell prompt.)


X RESOURCES

The appearance of the window can be customized by the user. Below are
the variables, with the default values. The values can be fine-tuned.
The expressions must be entered into a file on which the shell command
"xrdb -merge" is called.

xholhelp.height: 400
xholhelp.width: 600
xholhelp*font: 7x13bold

xholhelp*Dialog.value.width: 350
xholhelp*Dialog.value.height: 20
xholhelp*Command.height: 20

xholhelp*help_popup.x: 10
xholhelp*help_popup.y: 10

xholhelp*thms_popup.x: 10
xholhelp*thms_popup.y: 10

Enjoy! And, I am open to suggestions for improving the tool.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

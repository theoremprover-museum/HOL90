@\DOC PART_MATCH

\TYPE {PART_MATCH : ((term -> term) -> thm -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Instantiates a theorem by matching part of it to a term.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a `selector' function of type {term -> term}, a theorem and a
term:
{
   PART_MATCH fn (A |- !x1...xn. t) tm
}
\noindent the function {PART_MATCH} applies {fn} to {t'} (the result
of specializing universally quantified variables in the conclusion of
the theorem), and attempts to match the resulting term to the argument term
{tm}. If it succeeds, the appropriately instantiated version of the theorem is
returned.

\FAILURE
Fails if the selector function {fn} fails when applied to the instantiated
theorem, or if the match fails with the term it has provided.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose that we have the following theorem:
{
   th = |- !x. x==>x
}
\noindent
then the following:
{
   PART_MATCH (fst o dest_imp) th "T"
}
\noindent results in the theorem:
{
   |- T ==> T
}
\noindent because the selector function picks the antecedent of the implication
(the inbuilt specialization gets rid of the universal quantifier), and matches
it to {T}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {IMP_RES_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Enriches assumptions by repeatedly resolving an implication with them.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, resolution, implication.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem {th}, the theorem-tactic {IMP_RES_TAC} uses {RES_CANON} to
derive a canonical list of implications, each of which has the form:
{
   A |- u1 ==> u2 ==> ... ==> un ==> v
}
\noindent {IMP_RES_TAC} then tries to repeatedly `resolve' these theorems
against the assumptions of a goal by attempting to match the antecedents {u1},
{u2}, ..., {un} (in that order) to some assumption of the goal (i.e. to some
candidate antecedents among the assumptions).  If all the antecedents can be
matched to assumptions of the goal, then an instance of the theorem
{
   A u {{a1,...,an}} |- v
}
\noindent called a `final resolvent' is obtained by repeated specialization of
the variables in the implicative theorem, type instantiation, and applications
of modus ponens.  If only the first {i} antecedents {u1}, ..., {ui} can be
matched to assumptions and then no further matching is possible, then the final
resolvent is an instance of the theorem:
{
   A u {{a1,...,ai}} |- u(i+1) ==> ... ==> v
}
\noindent All the final resolvents obtained in this way (there may be several,
since an antecedent {ui} may match several assumptions) are added to the
assumptions of the goal, in the stripped form produced by using
{STRIP_ASSUME_TAC}.  If the conclusion of any final resolvent is a
contradiction `{F}' or is alpha-equivalent to the conclusion of the goal, then
{IMP_RES_TAC} solves the goal.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

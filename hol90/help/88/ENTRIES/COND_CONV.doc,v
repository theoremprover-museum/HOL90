@\DOC COND_CONV

\TYPE {COND_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies conditional terms.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conditional.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {COND_CONV} simplifies a conditional term {"c => u | v"} if
the condition {c} is either the constant {T} or the constant {F} or
if the two terms {u} and {v} are equivalent up to alpha-conversion.
The theorems returned in these three cases have the forms:
{
   |- (T => u | v) = u

   |- (F => u | v) = u

   |- (c => u | u) = u
}
\FAILURE
{COND_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not a conditional {"c => u | v"}, where
{c} is {T} or {F}, or {u} and {v} are alpha-equivalent.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {genlike : (term -> term)}

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a pair structure of variables whose names have not been previously used.

\DESCRIBE
When given a pair structure,
{genlike} returns a paired structure of variables whose names have not been 
used for variables or constants in the HOL session so far.
The structure of the term returned will be identical to the structure of the
argument.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following example illustrates the behaviour of {genlike}:
{
   #genlike "((1,2),(x:*,x:*))";;
   "(GEN%VAR%487,GEN%VAR%488),GEN%VAR%489,GEN%VAR%490" : term
}

\USES
Unique variables are useful in writing derived rules, for specializing
terms without having to worry about such things as free variable capture.
It is often important in such rules to keep the same structure.
If not, {genvar} will be adequate.
If the names are to be visible to a typical user, the function {pvariant} can
provide rather more meaningful names.

\SEEALSO
genvar, GPSPEC, pvariant.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

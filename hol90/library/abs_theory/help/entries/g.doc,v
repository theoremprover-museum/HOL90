\TYPE {g : (term -> void)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Initializes the subgoal package with a new goal which has no assumptions
except those created from the theory obligations.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   g "tm"
}
\noindent is equivalent to
{
   set_abs_goal([],"tm")
}
\noindent 
and clearly more convenient if a goal has no assumptions.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_abs_goal}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

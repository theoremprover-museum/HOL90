\TYPE {\small\verb%Ancestors : ((string list * string list) -> searchpath)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a {\small\verb%searchpath%} that consists of hierarchies of theory segments.

\DESCRIBE
A {\small\verb%searchpath%} is either a single theory segment, or it is a hierarchy of
theory segments. The latter is specified by a pair of lists. The theory
segments in the first list and all of their ancestors will be searched in a
breadth-first manner. No theory segment will be searched more than once. The
second list can be used to specify exclusions. Any theory segment in the
exclusion list or any ancestors of those theory segments will not be searched
unless they can be reached by a route which does not go through a theory
segment in the exclusion list. A {\small\verb%searchpath%} is generated from the pair of
lists by applying the function {\small\verb%Ancestors%}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\TYPE {\small\verb%ancestors_excluding : (string list -> string list -> searchpath)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a {\small\verb%searchpath%} that consists of hierarchies of theory segments.

\DESCRIBE
A {\small\verb%searchpath%} is either a single theory segment, or it is a hierarchy of
theory segments. The latter is specified by two lists. The theory segments in
the second list and all of their ancestors will be searched in a breadth-first
manner. No theory segment will be searched more than once. The first list can
be used to specify exclusions. Any theory segment in the exclusion list or any
ancestors of those theory segments will not be searched unless they can be
reached by a route which does not go through a theory segment in the exclusion
list. A {\small\verb%searchpath%} is generated by applying {\small\verb%ancestors_excluding%} to the
two lists. The exclusion list is given first so that by making a partial
application a default exclusion list can be set up.

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a {\small\verb%searchpath%} that consists of hierarchies of theory segments.

\DESCRIBE
A {\small\verb%searchpath%} is either a single theory segment, or it is a hierarchy of
theory segments. The latter is specified by a pair of lists. The theory
segments in the first list and all of their ancestors will be searched in a
breadth-first manner. No theory segment will be searched more than once. The
second list can be used to specify exclusions. Any theory segment in the
exclusion list or any ancestors of those theory segments will not be searched
unless they can be reached by a route which does not go through a theory
segment in the exclusion list. A {\small\verb%searchpath%} that does not include the main
theory hierarchy of the HOL system can be generated by applying the function
{\small\verb%Ancestry%} to a list of theory segments. {\small\verb%Ancestry%} uses {\small\verb%["HOL"]%} as its
exclusion list.

\TYPE {\small\verb%op contains : ((term * term) -> thmpattern)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Side-condition test. Tests the value bound to a pattern variable to see if
any part of it matches a new pattern.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%contains%} can be used to test whether part of a hypothesis or conclusion
contains a term, anywhere within it, that matches a pattern. Its first
argument is a variable used in a pattern for the hypothesis/conclusion. The
other argument is the pattern to be searched for within the term to which the
variable has been matched.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

A search can be performed using the function {\small\verb%full_search%}. It takes a pattern
and a source as arguments, and performs every step of the search without
pausing. If the source was a list of theorems there is only one step.
Otherwise, the steps correspond to searches of individual theory segments.
The result of {\small\verb%full_search%} is a list of theorems found during the search.

\DOC{has\_body}

\TYPE {\small\verb%op has_body : ((term * term) -> thmpattern)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Side-condition test. Tests the value bound to a pattern variable to see if
its body matches a new pattern.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%has_body%} can be used to test whether part of a hypothesis or conclusion
has, as its body, a term that matches a specified pattern. The first argument
is a variable used in a pattern for the hypothesis/conclusion. Let {\small\verb%t%} be the
term to which this variable has been bound. The second argument is the pattern
to be matched with the body of {\small\verb%t%}. The body of a term, in this context, is
the result of stripping any binders from the front of the term.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a pattern that matches a theorem if the conclusion is an implication
in which the consequent has a conjunction as its body:

terms {\small\verb%ts%}, when interpreted as patterns, match the hypotheses of the theorem.
Each term pattern must match to a distinct hypothesis, but if there are more
hypotheses than patterns, the match may still succeed. Variables in a term {\small\verb%t%}
match any term of a matching type. Type variables in {\small\verb%t%} match any type. If a

\DOC{matches}

\TYPE {\small\verb%op matches : ((term * term) -> thmpattern)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Side-condition test. Tests the value bound to a pattern variable to see if
it matches a new pattern.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%matches%} can be used to test whether part of a hypothesis or conclusion
is a term that matches a specified pattern. Its first argument is a variable
used in a pattern for the hypothesis/conclusion. The other argument is the
pattern to be matched with the term to which the variable has been bound. The
pattern is only tested directly against the term; no attempt is made to match
inside the term.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a pattern that matches a theorem if the conclusion is an equality in

an exception should do so with the exception {\small\verb%NO_MATCH%}.

\FAILURE
Fails if either of the term arguments is not a variable. May also cause a
failure to match, when used in a search, if either of the pattern variables do
not appear in the binding.

\SYNOPSIS
Function for generating a side-condition test from a predicate.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%test2types%} takes a predicate and two types as arguments and produces a
side-condition test. The types are pattern variables. When the side-condition
comes to be applied, the pattern variables are looked up in the binding
created by the match. The bound objects are then fed to the predicate. The
side-condition succeeds or fails based on the Boolean result.

Note that user defined functions which indicate a failure to match by raising
an exception should do so with the exception {\small\verb%NO_MATCH%}.

\FAILURE
Fails if either of the type arguments is not a type variable. May also cause a
failure to match, when used in a search, if either of the pattern variables do
not appear in the binding.

\TYPE {\small\verb%Theorem : thmkind%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Identifier denoting a `kind of theorem', specifically a derived theorem.

\USES
Used to generate patterns that test the `kind' of a theorem.

\SEEALSO
Axiom, Definition, kind.

\DOC{Theory}

\TYPE {\small\verb%Theory : (string -> searchpath)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a {\small\verb%searchpath%} that consists precisely of the named theory segment.

\DESCRIBE
A {\small\verb%searchpath%} is either a single theory segment, or it is a hierarchy of
theory segments. {\small\verb%Theory%} is used to generate a {\small\verb%searchpath%} of the first
kind. A search path is, as its name suggests, a specification of where a
search for theorems should take place.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\DOC{thmname}

\TYPE {\small\verb%thmname : (string -> thmpattern)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a pattern for testing the name of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%thmname s%} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
string {\small\verb%s%} when interpreted as a pattern for names matches the name of the
theorem. The string is used as a pattern in which {\small\verb%*%} is interpreted as
`match any number of characters (including none)' and {\small\verb%?%} is interpreted as
`match any single character'. All other characters in the string are taken
literally.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\TYPE {\small\verb%thryname : (string -> thmpattern)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a pattern for testing the name of the theory to which a theorem
belongs.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%thryname s%} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
string {\small\verb%s%} when interpreted as a pattern for names matches the name of the
theory to which the theorem belongs. The string is used as a pattern in
which {\small\verb%*%} is interpreted as `match any number of characters (including
none)' and {\small\verb%?%} is interpreted as `match any single character'. All other
characters in the string are taken literally.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\DOC{Where}

\TYPE {\small\verb%op Where : ((thmpattern * thmpattern) -> thmpattern)%}\egroup

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a pattern that attempts a match, and if this is successful applies
a test to the resulting binding.

\DESCRIBE
{\small\verb%Where%} is used for side-condition tests. Its first argument is a main clause.
The second argument is a side-condition clause and should only contain tests
on the bindings generated by the first argument. These tests may be combined
using the connectives {\small\verb%Andalso%}, {\small\verb%Orelse%} and {\small\verb%Not%}.

{\small\verb%Where%} should not occur within a side-condition clause. Strictly speaking,
side-condition tests should not be allowed to occur within a main clause.
However such an occurrence is interpreted as:
{\par\samepage\setseps\small
\begin{verbatim}
    (conc (--`conc:bool`--)) Where (<side-condition test>)
\end{verbatim}
}
\noindent This is only of use if the side-condition tests the binding of the
{\small\verb%(--`conc`--)%} pattern variable (a term).

\FAILURE
Fails if the second argument is not a legal side-condition. A side-condition
can only contain tests on bindings, and the connectives {\small\verb%Andalso%}, {\small\verb%Orelse%}
and {\small\verb%Not%}.

\TYPE {Compat.tyvarsl : (term list -> type list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the type variables free in a list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of terms, {tyvarsl} returns a list (possibly empty) of
the type variables which are free in any of those terms.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - tyvarsl [--`!x. x = 1`--, --`!x:'a. x = x`--];
  [(==`:'a`==)] : hol_type list
}
\USES
Finding all the free type variables in the assumptions of a theorem, as a check
on the validity of certain inferences.

\COMMENTS
{tyvarsl} does not appear in hol90. In the current HOL logic, there is no 
binding operation for types, so `is free in' is synonymous with `appears in'.

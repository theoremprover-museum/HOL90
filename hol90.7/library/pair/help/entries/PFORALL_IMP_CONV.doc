\TYPE {PFORALL_IMP_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, implication.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification inwards through an implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {!p. t ==> u}, where variables from {p}
are not free in both {t} and {u}, {PFORALL_IMP_CONV} returns a theorem of
one of three forms, depending on occurrences of the variables from {p} in {t}
and {u}.  If variables from {p} are free in {t} but none are in {u},
then the theorem:
{
   |- (!p. t ==> u) = (?p. t) ==> u
}
\noindent is returned.  If variables from {p} are free in {u} but none are
in {t}, then the result is:
{
   |- (!p. t ==> u) = t ==> (!p. u)
}
\noindent And if no variable from {p} is free in either {t} nor {u},
then the result is:
{
   |- (!p. t ==> u) = (?p. t) ==> (!p. u)
}
\FAILURE
{PFORALL_IMP_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{!p. t ==> u}, or if it is applied to a term {!p. t ==> u} in which
variables from {p} are free in both {t} and {u}.

@\DOC frees

\TYPE {Compat.frees : term -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the variables which are free in a term.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a term, {frees} returns a
list of the free variables in that term. There are no repetitions in the
list produced even if there are multiple free instances of some
variables.

\FAILURE
Never fails, unless the hol88 library has not been loaded.

\EXAMPLE
Clearly in the following term, {x} and {y} are free, whereas {z} is bound:
{
   - frees (--`(x=1) /\ (y=2) /\ (!z. z >= 0)`--);
   val it = [(--`x`--),(--`y`--)] : term list
}

\COMMENTS
{frees} is not in hol90; the function {free_vars} is used instead.
WARNING: the order of the list returned by {frees} and {free_vars} is 
different. 

    - val tm = (--`x (y:num):bool`--);
    val tm = (--`x y`--) : term
    - free_vars tm
    val it = [(--`y`--),(--`x`--)] : term list
    - frees tm;
    val it = [(--`x`--),(--`y`--)] : term list

It ought to be the case that the result of a call to {frees} (or {free_vars}) 
is treated as a set, that is, the order of the free variables should be 
immaterial. This is sometimes not possible; for example the result of gen_all
(and hence the results of GEN_ALL and new_axiom) necessarily depends on the
order of the variables returned from {frees}. The problem comes when users
write code that depends on the order of quantification. For example, contrary 
to some expectations, it is not the case that (tm being a closed term already)

    GEN_ALL (SPEC_ALL tm) = tm

where "=" is interpreted as identity or alpha-convertibility.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

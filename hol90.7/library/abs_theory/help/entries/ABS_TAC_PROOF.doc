\TYPE{ABS_TAC_PROOF : ((goal # tactic) -> thm)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove an abstract goal using a given tactic.

\DESCRIBE 

When applied to a goal-tactic pair {(A ?- t,tac)}, {ABS_TAC_PROOF}
attempts to prove the goal {A ?- t}, using the tactic {tac}. Before
the proof of {A ?- t} is attempted, the theory obligations for each
abstract object used in the goal are added to the assumption list.  If the
proof succeeds, it returns the theorem {A' |- t} corresponding to the
goal, where the assumption list {A'} may be a proper superset of {A}
unless the tactic is valid; there is no inbuilt validity checking.

\FAILURE
Fails if appropriate theory obligations cannot be found.
Fails unless the goal has hypotheses and conclusions all of type {bool},
and the tactic can solve the goal.

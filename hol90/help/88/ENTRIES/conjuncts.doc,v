@\DOC conjuncts

\TYPE {conjuncts : (term -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively splits conjunctions into a list of conjuncts.

\DESCRIBE
{conjuncts "t1 /\ ... /\ tn"} returns {["t1";...;"tn"]}.
The argument term may be any tree of conjunctions.
It need not have the form {"t1 /\ (t2 /\ ( ... /\ tn)...)"}.
A term that is not a conjunction is simply returned as the sole element of a
list. Note that

{
   conjuncts(list_mk_conj(["t1";...;"tn"]))
}
\noindent will not return {["t1";...;"tn"]} if any of {t1},...,{tn} are
conjunctions.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#list_mk_conj ["a /\ b";"c /\ d";"e /\ f"];;
"(a /\ b) /\ (c /\ d) /\ e /\ f" : term

#conjuncts it;;
["a"; "b"; "c"; "d"; "e"; "f"] : term list

#list_mk_conj it;;
"a /\ b /\ c /\ d /\ e /\ f" : term

#conjuncts "1";;
["1"] : term list
}
\COMMENTS
Because {conjuncts} splits both the left and right sides of a conjunction,
this operation is not the inverse of {list_mk_conj}. It may be useful to
introduce {list_dest_conj} for splitting only the right tails of a conjunction.

\SEEALSO
list_mk_conj, dest_conj.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {new_special_symbol : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Adds new string to the list of special symbols.

\DESCRIBE
An identifier, at the ML or object level, is either alphanumeric, e.g. {true}
or {T}, or consists of a special symbol which starts with a non-alphanumeric
character, e.g. {==>} or {+}. It is a consequence of the non-backtracking
implementation of lexical analysis that any (non-null) initial segment of a
special symbol is also a special symbol, so from the above we know that {==}
and {=} are. The function {new_special_symbol} makes the given string and its
non-null initial segments into special symbols, provided the string does not
start with an alphanumeric character (according to {is_alphanum}).

\FAILURE
Fails if the string provided starts with an alphanumeric character. The test is
performed using the function {is_alphanum}, so this may include some unexpected
characters if {new_alphanum} has been used.

\EXAMPLE
The call:
{
   new_special_symbol `.EQ.`;;
}
\noindent makes the following three strings special symbols:
{
   .E  .EQ  .EQ.
}

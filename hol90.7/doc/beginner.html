Before we start on an example, we will sketch just what hol90 is, for
those who have never seen an LCF-style theorem prover. The hol90 system
can be characterized as <A HREF = "manual.html#Using SML">SML/NJ</A>
with a lot of added support for doing Higher Order Logic.  On top of
SML, hol90 defines the types, terms, and theorems of the HOL logic. As
well, a great deal of support is available for reading, printing, and
manipulating values of these types.

<P>

A common style of hol90 interaction is for the user to work with the SML
<EM>top-level loop</EM>. This loop reads input until a complete phrase
has been found, then evaluates the phrase, then prints out the result
before resuming its wait for input. Let us start our proof work with a 
classic example: 
<P>
<EM>All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore, Socrates is mortal.
</EM>
<P>

How might this argument be represented in hol90? We start by entering our
terms.  In order to make the interaction more clear, we are going to
first turn off some specialized printing support:

<PRE>
    term_pp_prefix := "";  term_pp_suffix := "";
</PRE>

In the following, the dash (<KBD>-</KBD>) is the SML/NJ system prompt.
Everything that follows on that line is user input, ending with the
semicolon.

<PRE>
- val men_are_mortal = string_to_term "!(x:ind). Man x ==> Mortal x";
val men_are_mortal = `!x. Man x ==> Mortal x` : term
</PRE>

The contents of the second line is what SML has printed back as the
value of the input phrase. Let's look at the input phrase: it binds the
name <KBD>men_are_mortal</KBD> with the value of invoking the term
parser (<KBD>string_to_term</KBD>) on the string <KBD>"!(x:ind). Man x
==> Mortal x"</KBD>. This may be read aloud as <EM>For all x of type
individual, Man x implies Mortal x</EM>. The exclamation mark
(<KBD>!</KBD>) stands for the universal quantifier, and the
<KBD>==></KBD> symbol stands for the material implication. The
identifiers <KBD>Man</KBD> and <KBD>Mortal</KBD> stand for
predicates. HOL is a typed logic; the type <KBD>ind</KBD> of individuals
is one of its primitive types.

<P>

SML prints out the binding and tells us that is has type
<STRONG>term</STRONG>. The second term in our argument is introduced in
much the same way as the first:

<PRE>
- val socrates_is_a_man = string_to_term "(Man:ind->bool) Socrates";
val socrates_is_a_man = `Man Socrates` : term
</PRE>

The subexpression <KBD>(Man :ind -> bool)</KBD> constrains the predicate
<KBD>Man</KBD> to belong to a certain type; the expression is read as
<EM>Man has type individual to bool</EM>. Now we can make the argument. It
goes in three steps: we assume our terms, and then make use of a version
of <EM>modus ponens</EM> that uses matching to find the correct instantiation.

<PRE>
    - val th1 = ASSUME  men_are_mortal;
    val th1 = . |- !x. Man x ==> Mortal x : thm

    - val th2 = ASSUME  socrates_is_a_man;
    val th2 = . |- Man Socrates : thm

    - MATCH_MP th1 th2;
    val it = .. |- Mortal Socrates : thm
</PRE>

Notice that the bindings <KBD>th1</KBD>, <KBD>th2</KBD>, and
<KBD>it</KBD> are all of type <STRONG>thm</STRONG>. This means that they
represent theorems of the HOL logic. When these values are printed out,
there are "dots" to the left of the turnstile (<KBD>|-</KBD>): these are the
assumptions. We can discharge these:

<PRE>
    - DISCH_ALL it;
    val it = 
     |- Man Socrates ==> 
       (!x. Man x ==> Mortal x) ==> Mortal Socrates : thm
</PRE>

Using SML, we can package all this work up into one phrase and evaluate
it (incidentally, without adding any new top-level bindings, except for
the final theorem):

<PRE>
- MATCH_MP (ASSUME (Parse.string_to_term "!x:ind. Man x ==> Mortal x"))
           (ASSUME (Parse.string_to_term "(Man:ind->bool) Socrates"));

val it = .. |- Mortal Socrates : thm
</PRE>
<P>

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>. Ending a session with SML/NJ, and hence hol90,
is done by entering the end-of-file character (^D).
<P>

This example was a trivial example of reasoning in HOL. However,
the essence of the system has been demonstrated: theorems of the HOL
logic are proved by applying rules of inference, which are ML
functions. Theorem proving is just functional programming!

<P>

The technology in HOL scales up remarkably well: some of the largest
proofs performed to date have been done in hol90. Such efforts make
common use of quite sophisticated reasoning tools, but these tools are
always composed from simple inference rules such as those we have
demonstrated here.

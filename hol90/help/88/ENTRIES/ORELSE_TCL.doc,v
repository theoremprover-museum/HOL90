@\DOC ORELSE_TCL

\TYPE {$ORELSE_TCL : (thm_tactical -> thm_tactical -> thm_tactical)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a theorem-tactical, and if it fails, tries a second.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to two theorem-tacticals, {ttl1} and {ttl2}, a theorem-tactic
{ttac}, and a theorem {th}, if {ttl1 ttac th} succeeds, that gives the
result. If it fails, the result is {ttl2 ttac th}, which may itself fail.

\FAILURE
{ORELSE_TCL} fails if both the theorem-tacticals fail when applied to the
given theorem-tactic and theorem.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

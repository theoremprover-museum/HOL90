@\DOC DISCH_TAC

\TYPE {DISCH_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves the antecedent of an implicative goal into the assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, undischarge, antecedent, implication.

\DESCRIBE
{
    A ?- u ==> v
   ==============  DISCH_TAC
    A u {{u}} ?- v
}
\noindent Note that {DISCH_TAC} treats {"~u"} as {"u ==> F"}, so will also work
when applied to a goal with a negated conclusion.

\FAILURE
{DISCH_TAC} will fail for goals which are not implications or negations.

\USES
Solving goals of the form {"u ==> v"} by rewriting {"v"} with {"u"}, although
the use of {DISCH_THEN} is usually more elegant in such cases.

\COMMENTS
If the antecedent already appears in the assumptions, it will be duplicated.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

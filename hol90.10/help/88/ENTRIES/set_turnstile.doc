\DOC set_turnstile

\TYPE {set_turnstile : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets the `turnstile' symbol used in printing theorems.

\DESCRIBE
If {s} is a string, then {set_turnstile s} sets to {s} the `turnstile' symbol
(by default `{|- }') which is used to represent entailment, i.e. to separate
assumptions from conclusion when printing a theorem. The call returns the
previous string used for the turnstile.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows the turnstile being set to `{|= }'. A space is necessary
at the end to separate the conclusion neatly, but not at the beginning.
{
   #set_turnstile `|= `;;
   `|- ` : string

   #ASSUME "F";;
   . |= F
}

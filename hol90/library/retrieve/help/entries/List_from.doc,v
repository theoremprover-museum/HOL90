\TYPE {List_from : (searchstep -> source)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a source for a search from the result of a previous search.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
A {source} for a search can be either a list of search paths, or a list of
theorems found on a previous search. {List_from} generates a {source} of the
second kind from a step of a previous search. It extracts the list of found
theorems from the {searchstep}, and gives them to {List}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO

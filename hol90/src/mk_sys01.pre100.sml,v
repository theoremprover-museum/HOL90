1.1
log
@Keeping you up to date:

I'm about to do a checkin of elsa's modifications to the hol90.7
sources to create her hol90.pre8.  To recap what I've done:
	- I checked out hol90 (in /usr/groups/hol/drs1004/hol90)
		cvs co hol90
	  (Well, to be honest, I only checked out those
	  parts of hol90 I knew I'd be changing, e.g. not the
	  Manual, and only parts of the library.  Checking out the
	  entire source takes a while, mainly due to the enormous number
	  of help files.  The limiting factor is files/second, which
         runs at around 5 when CVS is working on nfs over a network, not
         KB/second, which you might at first think it would be).

	- By doing a recursive diff between Elsa's source and the
	hol90.7 source I found all the changes Elsa had made to
	source files.  I copied relevant files from Elsa's source
	into my checked out version.  The only new files were
		- the sml_system files in src/0
		- some make scripts in src/.
	Changed files were in:
		src/{0,1,2,3}
		library/arith/src/thm_convs.sml
		library/list/src/list_conv1.sml
		library/num/src/num_lib.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/halts_logic.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/translation.sml
		library/prog_logic/theories/src/mk_halts.sml
		library/real/theories/src/Make
		library/real/theories/src/equiv.sml
		library/real/theories/src/seq.sml
		library/reduce/src/arithconv.sml
		library/string/src/string_conv.sml
		library/unity/theories/src/aux_definitions.sml
		library/word/theories/src/*

	- I will now commit these changes, with this email as the log message.
		cvs commit

	- Tomorrow I will get this version compiling
	with NJSML 108 (I will probably add
	the files to enable the NJSML compilation manager to make
	this easier), then check those changes in.  I think it's
	good to get things in a working state.

1.1.2.1
log
@Theory files now build with SML/NJ 109, SML/NJ 108.5 (using CM), SML/NJ 0.93,
and Poly/ML 3.0.
The quotation filter has been modified so that antiquotation works correctly
in old-style quotations.
The quotation filter is now compiled using flex and gcc (by default).
The arguments to the script for running hol90 have been changed.

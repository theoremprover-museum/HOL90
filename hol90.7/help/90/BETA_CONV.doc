\DOC BETA_CONV

\TYPE {BETA_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs a simple beta-conversion.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {BETA_CONV} maps a beta-redex {"(\x.u)v"} to the theorem
{
   |- (\x.u)v = u[v/x]
}
\noindent where {u[v/x]} denotes the result of substituting {v} for all free
occurrences of {x} in {u}, after renaming sufficient bound variables to avoid
variable capture. This conversion is one of the primitive inference rules of
the HOL system.

\FAILURE
{BETA_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not a beta-redex.

\EXAMPLE
{
- let val tm = Parse.term_parser `(\x.x+1)y`
  in
  BETA_CONV tm
  end;
 val it = |- (\x. x + 1)y = y + 1 :thm

- let val tm = Parse.term_parser `(\x y. x+y)y`
  in
  BETA_CONV tm
  end;
val it = |- (\x y. x + y)y = (\y'. y + y') : thm
}
\COMMENTS
This primitive inference rule is actually not very primitive, since it does
automatic bound variable renaming. It would be logically cleaner for this
renaming to be derived rather than built-in, but since beta-reduction is so
common this would slow the system down a lot.  It is hoped to document the
exact renaming algorithm used by {BETA_CONV} in the future.

@\DOC EQ_LENGTH_INDUCT_TAC

\TYPE {EQ_LENGTH_INDUCT_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs tactical proof by structural induction on two equal length lists.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{EQ_LENGTH_INDUCT_TAC} reduces a goal
 {!x y . (LENGTH x = LENGTH y) ==> t[x,y]},
 where {x} and {y} range over lists, to two
subgoals corresponding to the base and step cases in a proof by 
induction on the length of {x} and {y}. The induction hypothesis appears among
the assumptions of the
subgoal for the step case.  The specification of {EQ_LENGTH_INDUCT_TAC} is:
{
         A ?- !x y . (LENGTH x = LENGTH y) ==> t[x,y]
   ====================================================  EQ_LENGTH_INDUCT_TAC
                            A ?- t[NIL/x][NIL/y]
    A u {{LENGTH x = LENGTH y, t[x'/x, y'/y]}} ?- 
         !h h'. t[(CONS h x)/x, (CONS h' y)/y]
}

\FAILURE
{EQ_LENGTH_INDUCT_TAC g} fails unless the conclusion of the goal {g} has the
 form 
{
   !x y . (LENGTH x = LENGTH y) ==> t[x,y]
}
\noindent  where the variables {x} and {y}
 have types {(xty)list} and {(yty)list} for some types {xty} and {yty}.
 It also fails if either of the variables {x} or {y} appear free in the
 assumptions. 

\USES
Use this tactic to perform structural induction over two lists that have
identical length.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

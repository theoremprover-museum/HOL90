1.1.2.1.2.1
log
@Many minor changes in order to get HOL to build on SML/NJ 109.26. There are
several real changes, however.

  1. The reliance on hacked ML-Yacc support files is gone.

  2. After type inference, there is now a pass where new names are guessed for
     unconstrained type variables. This is experimental.

  3. All the grammars used in the basic HOL system are put in one place
     (the "src/Grammars" directory).

  4. The implementations of the "Portable" structure have been moved to
      src/portableML.

  5. All the makefiles used to build the system are in src/Makefiles.

\TYPE {AP_THM : (thm -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of equal functions applied to a term.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- f = g} and a term {x}, the inference
rule {AP_THM} returns the theorem {A |- f x = g x}.
{
      A |- f = g
   ----------------  AP_THM (A |- f = g) x
    A |- f x = g x
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the conclusion of the theorem is an equation, both sides
of which are functions whose domain type is the same as that of the
supplied term.

@\DOC RESQ_MATCH_MP

\TYPE {RESQ_MATCH_MP : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminating a restricted universal quantification with automatic matching.

\KEYWORDS
rule, modus ponens, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- !x::P. Q[x]} and {A2 |- P x'}, the
derived inference rule {RESQ_MATCH_MP} matches {x'} to {x} by instantiating 
free or universally quantified variables in the first theorem (only),
and returns a theorem {A1 u A2 |- Q[x'/x]}. Polymorphic types are also
instantiated if necessary.

{
    A1 |- !x::P.Q[x]   A2 |- P x'
   --------------------------------------  RESQ_MATCH_MP
          A1 u A2 |- Q[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the first theorem is a (possibly repeatedly) restricted
universal quantification whose quantified variable can be instantiated
to match the conclusion of the second theorem, without instantiating
any variables which are free in {A1}, the first theorem's assumption list.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC set_library_search_path

\TYPE {set_library_search_path : (string list -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets the internal search path use by HOL to find libraries.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of strings {l}, each of which represents the pathname to
a directory, {set_library_search_path} sets the internal search path used when
the {load_library} function searches for library load files to the list {l}.
Although the library search path can be set to an arbitrary list of strings,
each string is normally expected to be a pathname with `{/}' as its final
character.  When {load_library} looks for a library load file, the directories
in the search path are searched in the order in which they occur in the list
supplied to {set_library_search_path}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE 
The following call adds a user's local library directory {~/hol/lib/} to the
library search path:
{
   set_library_search_path (union [`~/hol/lib/`] (library_search_path()));;
}
\noindent Users with local libraries would typically have a line of this form
in their {hol-init} file. Note that the function {union} is used to avoid
multiple occurrences of the same pathname in the library search path.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

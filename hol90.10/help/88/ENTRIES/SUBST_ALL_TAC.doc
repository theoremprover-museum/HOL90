\TYPE {SUBST_ALL_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Substitutes using a single equation in both the assumptions and conclusion of a
goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{SUBST_ALL_TAC} breaches the style of natural deduction, where the assumptions
are kept fixed.  Given a theorem {A|-u=v} and a goal {([t1;...;tn], t)},
{SUBST_ALL_TAC (A|-u=v)} transforms the assumptions {t1},...,{tn} and the term
{t} into {t1[v/u]},...,{tn[v/u]} and {t[v/u]} respectively, by substituting {v}
for each free occurrence of {u} in both the assumptions and the conclusion of
the goal.
{
           {{t1,...,tn}} ?- t
   =================================  SUBST_ALL_TAC (A|-u=v)
    {{t1[v/u],...,tn[v/u]}} ?- t[v/u]
}
\noindent The assumptions of the theorem used to substitute with are not added
to the assumptions of the goal, but they are recorded in the proof.  If {A} is
not a subset of the assumptions of the goal (up to alpha-conversion), then
{SUBST_ALL_TAC (A|-u=v)} results in an invalid tactic.

{SUBST_ALL_TAC} automatically renames bound variables to prevent
free variables in {v} becoming bound after substitution.

\FAILURE
{SUBST_ALL_TAC th (A,t)} fails if the conclusion of {th} is not an equation.
No change is made to the goal if no occurrence of the left-hand side of
{th} appears free in {(A,t)}.

\EXAMPLE
Simplifying both the assumption and the term in the goal
{
   {{0 + m = n}} ?- 0 + (0 + m) = n
}
\noindent by substituting with the theorem {|- 0 + m = m} for addition
{
   SUBST_ALL_TAC (CONJUNCT1 ADD_CLAUSES)
}
\noindent results in the goal
{
   {{m = n}} ?- 0 + m = n
}

\DOC activate_all_binders

\TYPE {activate_all_binders : (string -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes the quotation parser treat all binders in ancestor theories as such.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   activate_all_binders `thy`
}
\noindent where {thy} is an ancestor theory ({`-`} stands for the current
theory), will return a list of all binders on that theory and its ancestors,
and make the parser treat them all as binders, that is, for each binder {b},
will allow the syntactic sugaring {"b x. y"} as a shorthand for {"b (\x. y)"}.
The special syntactic status may be suppressed by preceding {b} with a dollar
sign. The function returns a list of all the binders dealt with.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
This function is mainly intended for internal use. All binders declared by
{new_binder} or {new_binder_definition} are always parsed as such anyway.

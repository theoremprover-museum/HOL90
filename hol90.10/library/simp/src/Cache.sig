 (*------------------------------------------------------------------
  * CACHE
  *
  * Cache an operation which depends on a set of theorems as
  * part of its input - e.g. "contextual" decision procedures
  * such as CTXT_ARITH
  *
  * Two arguments are needed.  The
  * first should determine if a given theorem is relevant to
  * the decision procedure.  The second should be a conversion
  * i.e. convert a term t to |- t = x for some value x.
  *
  * Returns a new conversion, and a reference to a table used 
  * as a cache.  The table is returned to enable users to
  * analyse its contents (functions will be provided for this at a later
  * date)

1.3
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

(* *************************************************************************
 *
 * This module codifies the arguments given to make_hol. The calling 
 * convention for make_hol is:
 * 
 *     make_hol <sml> [-n | -b | -o] [-d <path>]
 * 
 * The default, calling make_hol with no parameters, tells the system to
 * re-use the existing ascii theory files. One must be in hol90.4/src to
 * invoke this. If you aren't there, the "-d" option must be used.
 * 
 *     -o  This is the same as calling the default.
 * 
 *     -n  The "-n" option tells the system to rebuild all its theories. Be
 *         warned that a consequence of this option is that all user theories 
 *         at the site will have to be rebuilt.
 * 
 *     -b  The "-b" option tells the system to build binary theories. This 
 *         is not advised, and some editing of the sys01.sml file is 
 *         necessary to get this approach to work.
 * 
 *     -d <path> This option to make_hol is used to establish the root
 *         directory for hol90. If your current directory at the 
 *         time of calling "make_hol" is not hol90.4/src, then you 
 *         will need to supply the full directory path to the hol90.4 
 *         directory.
 * 
 * The default and the "-n" and "-o" options entail that theory files will
 * be in ascii. This is preferable, since ascii files are portable between
 * architectures and are much smaller than binary theory files.

Manual configuration.

One can manually configure the system by 

    a) Setting the values of theory_file_option and HOL_base_directory in
       this file.

    b) By commenting out the code that currently sets these values in
       this file.

    c) By not using the line

           $* < sys01.sml

       in the make_hol shell script. Instead one would invoke sml, then do a
   
           use "sys01.sml";

       After that finished, the rest of the make_hol shell script should be 
       invoked.


Here are some hints for part a.

If you want ascii theory files and you want to rebuild all the
theories anew, you should do

    val theory_file_option = make_new_ascii

If you want binary versions of theory files, you should use

    val theory_file_option = make_binary

If you chose either of the above two options, you will have to remake
all libraries and site theories. If you use binary format you will have
to modify the file sys01.sml too.

If you wish to reuse existing ascii theory files, thereby avoiding
having to remake libraries and local theories, you should use

    val theory_file_option = use_old_ascii

You will need to use the "use_old_ascii" option on all but the first
build when building hol90 on multiple architectures which are all to
share the same theory files.

Warning: the "use_old_ascii" option is not as secure as the other two.
It also may not always be possible when building a new version of hol90
for the first time at your site. SYSTEM THEORY FILES MAY CHANGE BETWEEN
RELEASES.

@Keeping you up to date:

I'm about to do a checkin of elsa's modifications to the hol90.7
sources to create her hol90.pre8.  To recap what I've done:
	- I checked out hol90 (in /usr/groups/hol/drs1004/hol90)
		cvs co hol90
	  (Well, to be honest, I only checked out those
	  parts of hol90 I knew I'd be changing, e.g. not the
	  Manual, and only parts of the library.  Checking out the
	  entire source takes a while, mainly due to the enormous number
	  of help files.  The limiting factor is files/second, which
         runs at around 5 when CVS is working on nfs over a network, not
         KB/second, which you might at first think it would be).

	- By doing a recursive diff between Elsa's source and the
	hol90.7 source I found all the changes Elsa had made to
	source files.  I copied relevant files from Elsa's source
	into my checked out version.  The only new files were
		- the sml_system files in src/0
		- some make scripts in src/.
	Changed files were in:
		src/{0,1,2,3}
		library/arith/src/thm_convs.sml
		library/list/src/list_conv1.sml
		library/num/src/num_lib.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/halts_logic.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/translation.sml
		library/prog_logic/theories/src/mk_halts.sml
		library/real/theories/src/Make
		library/real/theories/src/equiv.sml
		library/real/theories/src/seq.sml
		library/reduce/src/arithconv.sml
		library/string/src/string_conv.sml
		library/unity/theories/src/aux_definitions.sml
		library/word/theories/src/*

	- I will now commit these changes, with this email as the log message.
		cvs commit

	- Tomorrow I will get this version compiling
	with NJSML 108 (I will probably add
	the files to enable the NJSML compilation manager to make
	this easier), then check those changes in.  I think it's
	good to get things in a working state.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

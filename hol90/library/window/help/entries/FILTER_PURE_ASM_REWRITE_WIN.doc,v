@\DOC FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN

\BLTYPE
FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN : (term -> bool) -> thm list ->
win_stack -> win_stack
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly rewrite the focus with selected context and theorems.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} repeatedly rewrites the focus of
the top window with {thms} and those theorems in the context of the
window, the conclusions of which satisfy the predicate {p}.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} will fail if the hypotheses of
any of the theorems in {thms} are not a subset of the conjectures of
the window. This function may fail to terminate if {thms}, or the
selected terms in the context, describe a circular rewriting.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

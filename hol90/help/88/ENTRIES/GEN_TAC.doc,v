@\DOC GEN_TAC

\TYPE {GEN_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips the outermost universal quantifier from the conclusion of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- !x. t}, the tactic {GEN_TAC} reduces it to
{A ?- t[x'/x]} where {x'} is a variant of {x} chosen to avoid clashing with any
variables free in the goal's assumption list. Normally {x'} is just {x}.
{
     A ?- !x. t
   ==============  GEN_TAC
    A ?- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is universally quantified.

\USES
The tactic {REPEAT GEN_TAC} strips away any universal quantifiers, and
is commonly used before tactics relying on the  underlying term structure.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

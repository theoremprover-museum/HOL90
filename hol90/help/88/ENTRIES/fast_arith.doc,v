@\DOC fast_arith

\TYPE {fast_arith : (bool -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Switches fast, finite-precision arithmetic either on or off.

\DESCRIBE
HOL normally does arithmetic using arbitrary precision. It can be changed to
use faster, finite-precision arithmetic by {fast_arith true}, and the normal
behaviour restored with {fast_arith false}. The current state does not affect
the mode of arithmetic in previously defined functions, such as {num_CONV}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#fast_arith true;;
() : void

#let pow2 x = funpow x (curry $* 2) 1;;
pow2 = - : (int -> int)

#map pow2 [30; 31; 32; 33];;
[1073741824; -2147483648; 0; 0] : int list
}
\COMMENTS
This function is extremely dependent on the version of Lisp used, and its
behaviour should not be relied upon; it may not work at all in Lisps other than
Franz. It is questionable whether it is ever worthwhile to use it anyway,
because although it cannot compromise the consistency of the logic, it can
lead to confusing failures if one is manipulating numbers larger than the word
size of the machine.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC LE_CONV

\TYPE {LE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves result of less-than-or-equal-to ordering on two numerals.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are both numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{LE_CONV "m <= n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (m <= n) = T
}
\noindent if the natural number denoted by {m} is less than or equal to that
denoted by {n}, or
{
   |- (m <= n) = F
}
\noindent otherwise.

\FAILURE
{LE_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form {"m <= n"}, where {m} and {n}
are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#LE_CONV "12 <= 198";;
|- 12 <= 198 = T

#LE_CONV "46 <= 46";;
|- 46 <= 46 = T

#LE_CONV "13 <= 12";;
|- 13 <= 12 = F
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

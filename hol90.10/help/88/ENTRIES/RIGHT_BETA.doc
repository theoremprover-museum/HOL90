\DOC RIGHT_BETA

\TYPE {RIGHT_BETA : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Beta-reduces a top-level beta-redex on the right-hand side of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an equational theorem, {RIGHT_BETA} applies beta-reduction at
top level to the right-hand side (only). Variables are renamed if necessary to
avoid free variable capture.
{
    A |- s = (\x. t1) t2
   ----------------------  RIGHT_BETA
     A |- s = t1[t2/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational, with its right-hand side being
a top-level beta-redex.

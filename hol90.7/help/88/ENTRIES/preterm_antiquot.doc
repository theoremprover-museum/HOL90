\DOC preterm_antiquot

\TYPE {preterm_antiquot : (term -> preterm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs antiquoted preterm.

\DESCRIBE
{preterm_antiquot} is analogous to the oft-used HOL strategy of antiquotation.
Since, however, preterms are untypechecked terms, the restrictions imposed
when using antiquotation are not encountered until the preterm is typechecked.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#preterm_antiquot "T";;
preterm_antiquot"T" : preterm

#preterm_comb(preterm_const `~`,it);;
preterm_comb((preterm_const `~`), preterm_antiquot"T") : preterm

#preterm_to_term it;;
"~T" : term
}

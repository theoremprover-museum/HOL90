@\DOC AND_EXISTS_CONV

\TYPE {AND_EXISTS_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves an existential quantification outwards through a conjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(?x.P) /\ (?x.Q)}, where {x} is free
in neither {P} nor {Q}, {AND_EXISTS_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (?x. P) /\ (?x. Q) = (?x. P /\ Q)
}
\FAILURE
{AND_EXISTS_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{(?x.P) /\ (?x.Q)}, or if it is applied to a term {(?x.P) /\ (?x.Q)}
in which the variable {x} is free in either {P} or {Q}.

\SEEALSO
EXISTS_AND_CONV, LEFT_AND_EXISTS_CONV, RIGHT_AND_EXISTS_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC UNDISCH

\TYPE {UNDISCH : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Undischarges the antecedent of an implicative theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, undischarge, antecedent.

\DESCRIBE
{
    A |- t1 ==> t2
   ----------------  UNDISCH
     A, t1 |- t2
}
\noindent Note that {UNDISCH} treats {"~u"} as {"u ==> F"}.

\FAILURE
{UNDISCH} will fail on theorems which are not implications or negations.

\COMMENTS
If the antecedent already appears in the hypotheses, it will not be duplicated.
However, unlike {DISCH},
if the antecedent is alpha-equivalent to one of the hypotheses,
it will still be added to the hypotheses.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

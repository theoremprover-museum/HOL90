\DOC RESQ_MATCH_MP

\TYPE {RESQ_MATCH_MP : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminating a restricted universal quantification with automatic matching.

\KEYWORDS
rule, modus ponens, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- !x::P. Q[x]} and {A2 |- P x'}, the
derived inference rule {RESQ_MATCH_MP} matches {x'} to {x} by instantiating 
free or universally quantified variables in the first theorem (only),
and returns a theorem {A1 u A2 |- Q[x'/x]}. Polymorphic types are also
instantiated if necessary.

}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the first theorem is a (possibly repeatedly) restricted
universal quantification whose quantified variable can be instantiated
to match the conclusion of the second theorem, without instantiating
any variables which are free in {A1}, the first theorem's assumption list.

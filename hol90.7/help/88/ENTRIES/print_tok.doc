\DOC print_tok

\TYPE {print_tok : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints an ML string to the terminal (with surrounding string quotes).

\DESCRIBE
{print_tok s} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the string
{s} to the terminal. String quotes are printed around the string but the text
is not terminated with a carriage return. In fact, the text is queued until
the pretty-printer decides where line breaks are needed, or until the queue is
explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_tok `This is an example`;;
`This is an example`() : void
}
\SEEALSO

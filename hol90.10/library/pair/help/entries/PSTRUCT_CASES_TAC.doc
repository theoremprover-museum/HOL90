\KEYWORDS
tactic, cases.

\SYNOPSIS
Performs very general structural case analysis.

\DESCRIBE
When it is applied to a theorem of the form:
{
   th = A' |- ?p11...p1m. (x=t1) /\ (B11 /\ ... /\ B1k) \/ ... \/
                ?pn1...pnp. (x=tn) /\ (Bn1 /\ ... /\ Bnp)
}
\noindent in which there may be no paired existential quantifiers where a
`vector' of them is shown above, {PSTRUCT_CASES_TAC th} splits a goal
{A ?- s} into {n} subgoals as follows:
{
                             A ?- s
   ===============================================================
    A u {{B11,...,B1k}} ?- s[t1/x] ... A u {{Bn1,...,Bnp}} ?- s[tn/x]
}
\noindent that is, performs a case split over the possible constructions (the
{ti}) of a term, providing as assumptions the given constraints, having
split conjoined constraints into separate assumptions. Note that unless {A'}
is a subset of {A}, this is an invalid tactic.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem has the above form, namely a conjunction of
(possibly multiply paired existentially quantified) terms which assert the
equality of the same variable {x} and the given terms.

\USES
Generating a case split from the axioms specifying a structure.

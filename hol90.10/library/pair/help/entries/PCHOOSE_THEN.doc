theorem-tactic, existential.

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic generated from the body of paired existentially quantified
theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactic {ttac}, a paired existentially quantified
theorem:
{
    A' |- ?p. t
}
and a goal, {CHOOSE_THEN} applies the tactic {ttac (t[p'/p] |- t[p'/p])} to
the goal, where {p'} is a variant of the pair {p} chosen to have no
components free in the assumption list of the goal. Thus if:
{
    A ?- s1
   =========  ttac (t[q'/q] |- t[q'/q])
    B ?- s2
}
\noindent then
{
    A ?- s1
   ==========  CHOOSE_THEN ttac (A' |- ?q. t)
    B ?- s2
}
\noindent This is invalid unless {A'} is a subset of {A}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theorem is a paired existential quantification,
or if the resulting tactic fails when applied to the goal.

\TYPE {continue_search : (searchstep -> searchstep)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to continue a search.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
A search can be continued using the function {continue_search}. It takes a
step of a search as argument, and performs the next step of the search. The
steps correspond to searches of individual theory segments.

\FAILURE
Fails if the step given as argument is a final step. The function may fail for
other reasons. Since the user may supply his/her own side-condition functions
at the beginning of the search, an exhaustive list of possible failures cannot
be given.

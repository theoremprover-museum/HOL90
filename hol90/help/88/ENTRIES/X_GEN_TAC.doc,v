@\DOC X_GEN_TAC

\TYPE {X_GEN_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes a goal with the given variable.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {x'}, which should be a variable, and a goal
{A ?- !x. t}, the tactic {X_GEN_TAC} returns the goal {A ?- t[x'/x]}.
{
     A ?- !x. t
   ==============  X_GEN_TAC "x'"
    A ?- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is universally quantified and the term a
variable of the appropriate type. It also fails if the variable given is free
in either the assumptions or (initial) conclusion of the goal.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC P_PCHOOSE_TAC

\TYPE {P_PCHOOSE_TAC : (term -> thm_tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, witness, quantifier, existential.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Assumes a theorem, with existentially quantified pair replaced by a given
witness.

\DESCRIBE
{P_PCHOOSE_TAC} expects a pair {q} and theorem with a paired existentially
quantified conclusion.  When applied to a goal, it adds a new
assumption obtained by introducing the pair {q} as a witness for
the pair {p} whose existence is asserted in the theorem.
{
           A ?- t
   ===================  P_CHOOSE_TAC "q" (A1 |- ?p. u)
    A u {{u[q/p]}} ?- t         ("y" not free anywhere)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not a paired existential quantification,
or if the first argument is not a paired structure of variables.  
Failures may arise in the tactic-generating function.  
An invalid tactic is produced if the introduced variable is free in {u} or {t},
or if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an 
assumption of the goal.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

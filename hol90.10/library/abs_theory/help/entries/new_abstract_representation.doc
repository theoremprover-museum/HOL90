\TYPE {new_abstract_representation : string -> (string # type) list -> thm}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new abstract representation.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {new_abstract_representation name decl} creates a new abstract
structure with the name {name} using the declaration list {decl}, where
{decl} is a list of string--type pairs giving the name and type of the
constituent abstract objects.  
The structure name, {name}, is used as the constructor when building
representations. 
The returned theorem is used by the function {abs_type_info}.

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the names have been used in the theory segment.

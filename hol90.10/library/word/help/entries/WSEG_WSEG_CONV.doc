\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the result of taking a segment from a segment of
a word.

\DESCRIBE
For any word {w} of size {n}, the result of evaluating
{
   WSEG_WSEG_CONV "n" "WSEG m2 k2 (WSEG m1 k1 w)"
}
\noindent where {m2}, {k2}, {m1} and {k1} must be numeric constants,
is the theorem
{
   PWORDLEN n w |- WSEG m2 k2 (WSEG m1 k1 w) = WSEG m2 k w
}
\noindent where {k} is a numeric constant whose value is the sum of
{k1} and {k2}.

\FAILURE
{WSEG_WSEG_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above,
or the relations {k1 + m1 <= n} and {k2 + m2 <= m1} are not satisfied.

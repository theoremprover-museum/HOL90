\DOC axiom

\TYPE {axiom : (string -> string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads an axiom from a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call of {axiom "thy" "ax"} returns axiom {ax} from the theory segment {thy}.
The theory segment {thy} must be part of the current theory. The name {ax} is
the name given to the axiom by the user when it was originally added to the
theory segment (by a call to {new_axiom}).  The name of the current theory
segment can be abbreviated by {"-"}.

\FAILURE
The call {axiom "thy" "ax"} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not part
of the current theory. It will also fail if there does not exist an axiom of 
name {ax} in theory segment {thy}.

\EXAMPLE
{
 - axiom "bool" "BOOL_CASES_AX";
val it = |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F) : thm

}

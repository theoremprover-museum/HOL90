\DOC FILTER_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC

\TYPE {FILTER_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC : ((term -> bool) -> thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal once including built-in rewrites and some of its assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, selective.

\DESCRIBE
The first argument is a predicate applied to the assumptions. The goal is
rewritten with the assumptions for which the predicate returns {true}, the
given list of theorems, and the tautologies stored in {basic_rewrites}. It
searches the term of the goal once, without applying rewrites recursively. Thus
it avoids the divergence which can result from the application of
{FILTER_ASM_REWRITE_TAC}. For more information on rewriting tactics, see
{GEN_REWRITE_TAC}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
This function is useful when rewriting with a subset of assumptions of
a goal, allowing control of the number of rewriting passes.

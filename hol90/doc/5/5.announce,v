@hol90 version 5 is available for anonymous ftp from Munich and Bell Labs.

This release is mainly to synchronize with the latest release of SML/NJ,
to make some important libraries available, and to fix a few bugs in the
implementation of libraries.

hol90 will no longer be available from the Calgary ftp site.


System overview.

hol90 is a re-implementation in SML/NJ of the Cambridge HOL system,
version 2.01. The proof support of hol90 (term manipulation, axioms,
inference rules, tactics, conversions, theories, libraries, etc.) is
intended to be an identical replacement for that of hol88, version 2.01.

There are of course some differences in the two systems. These are
discussed in detail in the release notes that come with the system. The
differences between the two systems generally lie in the "systems
support" aspect: how paths are administered, how autoloading works, the
nature of theory files, how quotation, antiquotation, and prettyprinting
work, etc.

hol90 runs proofs 2 to 4 times faster than hol88, but requires a
workstation with a lot of memory: 16Meg. does not give a large SML/NJ
program much breathing room. I recommend at least 24 Megabytes. The
hol90.5 image is approximately 8.2 Meg on disk and constructs a large
heap at runtime.


How to get it.

To build hol90, one must have the SML/NJ compiler, version 0.92 or
greater, which is available from research.att.com and also princeton.edu.
The installation guide in the hol90 sources gives full details. First
though, one must get the hol90 sources. These are available by anonymous
ftp from 

    Site                                File
    ----                                ----
    ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de      lehrstuhl/nipkow/hol90/hol90.5.tar.Z
or
    research.att.com                   dist/ml/hol90/hol90.5.tar.Z


An example session would be

    % ftp ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de
    Connected to dsrbg2.informatik.tu-muenchen.de.

            .
            .
            .
    ftp> quit
    %

Once you have hol90.5.tar.Z, it can be unpacked by

    zcat hol90.5.tar.Z | tar xf -

This gives a directory hol90.5, with subdirectories "contrib", "doc",
"src", "help", "library", "tools", and "theories". The installation
guide is in the file "install.doc" in hol90.5/doc. Since this is a new
release, users will have to rebuild all of their theory files.

Matthew Morley, Richard Boulton, KimDam Peterson, Flemming Anderson,
Paul Loewenstein, and David Shepherd did most of the work in porting the
libraries.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC library_search_path

\TYPE {library_search_path : (void -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the internal search path use by HOL to find libraries.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {library_search_path()} returns a list of strings representing the
pathnames of the directories that are searched when the {load_library} function
searches for libraries. Although the library search path can be set to an
arbitrary list of strings, each string is normally expected to be a pathname
with `{/}' as its final character.  When {load_library} looks for a library
load file, the directories in the library search path are searched in the order
in which they occur in the list returned by {library_search_path}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

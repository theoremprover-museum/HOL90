 * I modified this to make it a simple structure instead of a
 * functor.  I couldn't see any benefit accruing out of the use of a
 * functor here, parameterized over Term, Theorem, Parser etc.  
 * Maybe theories could be parameterized over
 * other things (e.g. other theories), but not these core things surely?

1.1
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

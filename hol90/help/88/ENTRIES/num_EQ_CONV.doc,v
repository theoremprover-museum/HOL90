@\DOC num_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {num_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality or inequality of two natural number constants.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, number, arithmetic.

\DESCRIBE
If {n} and {m} are two distinct numeral constants (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2},
{3},...), then {num_EQ_CONV "n = m"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (n = m) = F
}
\noindent If {n} and {m} are successors of numeral constants (e.g. {SUC 0},
{SUC 1}, {SUC(SUC 1)} etc.), then {num_EQ_CONV "n = m"} returns one of:
{
   |- (n = m) = T       or       |- (n = m) = F
}
\noindent depending on whether the natural numbers represented by {n} and {m}
are equal or not equal, respectively. Finally, for any term {"n"} of type
{num}, evaluating {num_EQ_CONV "n = n"} returns {|- (n = n) = T}.

\FAILURE
{num_EQ_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form {"n = m"}, where {n} and {m}
are either numerals or repeated applications of {SUC} to numerals unless {n}
and {m} are syntactically identical terms of type {num}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#num_EQ_CONV "1 = SUC 2";;
|- (1 = SUC 2) = F

#num_EQ_CONV "SUC 1 = 2";;
|- (SUC 1 = 2) = T
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

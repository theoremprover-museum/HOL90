@\DOC mk_primed_var

\TYPE {mk_primed_var : {{Name : string, Ty : hol_type}} -> term}

\SYNOPSIS
Primes a variable name sufficiently to make it distinct from all constants.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a record made from string {"v"} and a type {ty}, the
function {mk_primed_var} constructs a variable whose name consists of {v} 
followed by however many primes are necessary to make it distinct from any 
constants in the current theory. 

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{- new_theory "wombat";
() : unit

- mk_primed_var{{Name = "x", Ty = ==`:bool`==}};
(--`x`--) : term

- new_constant{{Name = "x", Ty = ==`:num`==}};
() : unit

- mk_primed_var{{Name = "x",Ty = ==`:bool`==}};
(--`x'`--) : term
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {close_theory : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Finishes a session in draft mode, writing changes to the theory file.

\DESCRIBE
Executing {close_theory()} finishes a session in draft mode. It switches the
system to proof mode. Changes made to the current theory segment are written to
the theory file associated with it. For a theory segment named {`thy`}, the
associated file will be {thy.th} in the directory from which HOL was called. If
the theory file does not exist, it will be created.
If HOL is quitted before {close_theory} is invoked, the additions made to the
segment may not persist to future HOL sessions. Whilst in proof mode, the only
changes which may be made to the theory are the addition of theorems. The
theory segment may later be extended with {extend_theory}.

\FAILURE
A call to {close_theory} will fail if the system is not in draft mode.
Since it involves writing to the file system, if the write fails for
any reason {close_theory} will fail.

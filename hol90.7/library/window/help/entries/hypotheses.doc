\TYPE {hypotheses : (window -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
The set of hypotheses of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
This is the list of things that may be assumed in the context of a
window.  {hypotheses} may not present these things in the same way
as they are printed interactively.   Use {disp_hyposesthese} to get
the set of hypotheses that are printed for interactive use.

\EXAMPLE
{
- BEGIN_STACK "hyp-ex" (--`($=) ((A /\ B) /\ C)`--) [] [];

= * (A /\ B) /\ C
val it = () : unit
- DO (OPEN_WIN [RAND]);

  ! B
  ! A
= * C
val it = () : unit
- hypotheses (top_window (CURRENT_STACK ()));
val it = [(--`A /\ B`--)] : term list
}

\FAILURE
Never fails.

@\DOC RESQ_REWRITE1_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_REWRITE1_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewriting with a restricted universally quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, rewriting, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
{RESQ_REWRITE1_TAC} takes an equational theorem which is restricted universally
quantified at the outer level. It calls {RESQ_REWR_CANON} to convert
the theorem to the form accepted by {COND_REWR_TAC} and passes the
resulting theorem to this tactic which carries out conditional
rewriting.

Suppose that {th} is the following theorem
{
   A |- !x::P. Q[x] = R[x])
}
\noindent Applying the tactic {RESQ_REWRITE1_TAC th} to a goal {(asml,gl)}
will return a main subgoal {(asml',gl')} where {gl'} is obtained by
substituting instances of {R[x'/x]} for corresponding instances of
{Q[x'/x]} in the original goal {gl}. All instances of {P x'} which
do not appear in the original assumption {asml} are added to it to
form {asml'}, and they also become new subgoals {(asml,P x')}.

\FAILURE
{RESQ_REWRITE1_TAC th}  fails if {th} cannot be transformed into the
required form by the function {RESQ_REWR_CANON}. Otherwise, it fails if no 
match is found or the theorem cannot be instantiated.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

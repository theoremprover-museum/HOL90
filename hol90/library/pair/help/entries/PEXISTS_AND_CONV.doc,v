@\DOC PEXISTS_AND_CONV

\TYPE {PEXISTS_AND_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, conjunction.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired existential quantification inwards through a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {?p. t /\ u}, where variables in {p} are
not free in both {t} and {u}, {PEXISTS_AND_CONV} returns a theorem of one of
three forms, depending on occurrences of variables from {p} in {t} and {u}.  
If {p} contains variables free in {t} but none in {u}, then the theorem:
{
   |- (?p. t /\ u) = (?p. t) /\ u
}
\noindent is returned.  If {p} contains variables free in {u} but none in {t},
then the result is:
{
   |- (?p. t /\ u) = t /\ (?x. u)
}
\noindent And if {p} does not contain any variable free in either {t} nor {u},
then the result is:
{
   |- (?p. t /\ u) = (?x. t) /\ (?x. u)
}
\FAILURE
{PEXISTS_AND_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{?p. t /\ u}, or if it is applied to a term {?p. t /\ u} in which 
variables in {p} are free in both {t} and {u}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

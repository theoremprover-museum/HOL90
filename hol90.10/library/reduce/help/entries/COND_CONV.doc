\DOC COND_CONV

\TYPE {COND_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies certain conditional expressions.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} corresponds to one of the forms given below, where {b} has type {bool}
and {t1} and {t2} have the same type, then {COND_CONV tm} returns the
corresponding theorem. Note that in the last case the arms need only be
alpha-equivalent rather than strictly identical.
{
   COND_CONV "F => t1 | t2" = |- (T => t1 | t2) = t2
   COND_CONV "T => t1 | t2" = |- (T => t1 | t2) = t1
   COND_CONV "b => t | t    = |- (b => t | t) = t
}

\FAILURE
{COND_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has one of the forms indicated above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#COND_CONV "F => F | T";;
|- (F => F | T) = T

#COND_CONV "T => F | T";;
|- (T => F | T) = F

#COND_CONV "b => (\x. SUC x) | (\p. SUC p)";;
|- (b => (\x. SUC x) | (\p. SUC p)) = (\x. SUC x)
}

\TYPE {set_help_search_path : (string list -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets the internal search path use by HOL to find files.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of strings {l}, each of which represents the pathname
to a directory, {set_help_search_path} sets the internal search path used when
the {help} function searches for online help files to the list {l}. Although
the help search path can be set to an arbitrary list of strings, each string is
normally expected to be either empty ({``}) or a pathname with `{/}' as its
final character.  When {help} looks for a help file, the directories in the
search path are searched in the order in which they occur in the list supplied
to {set_help_search_path}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\DOC END_STACK_TAC

\TYPE {END_STACK_TAC : (unit -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Closes a subwindow opened on the current goal of the subgoals package.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{END_STACK_TAC} name closes all the subwindows on the window stack
called {"TACTIC STACK"} and returns to the parent window of the stack.
The theorem in this window is used to generate a theorem of the form
{(H |- goal' ==> goal)} where {goal} is the current goal of the
subgoal package.  The current goal is transformed from {goal} to
{goal'} and the stack named {"TACTIC STACK"} is ended.

\FAILURE
{END_STACK_TAC} will fail if you have done any other tactical
reasoning since opening the window with {BEGIN_STACK_TAC}.
{END_STACK_TAC} will also fail if there are any used conjectures in
the current window.

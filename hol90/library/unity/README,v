@This directory contains the hol90 UNITY library, due to Flemming Andersen.

The library defines the basic temporal operators in the (full-state) UNITY
logic [K. Chandy, J. Misra: Parallel Program Design -- A foundation] and
contains theorems corresponding to the properties of these.

The installation guide below should be performed when installing the hol90
system.  Hence, if the hol90 command

	- known_libraries();

indicates that the unity library has been declared you may skip this step.

To use the library follow the instructions in Loading Guide.


Installation Guide:
------------------

  The UNITY library creates a hiearchy of theories grounded in the HOL
theory.  These theories will be build by invoking the shell command:

	% make_unity [hol90]


Next the UNITY library should be declared to hol90. This is already done
in the hol90 building process: see src/3/sys_lib.sml.


Loading Guide:
-------------

  The UNITY library is loaded by the hol90 library command:

	- load_library{lib= unity_lib, theory= <name>};

The <name> of the theory is up to the user. One can also use 
"load_library_in_place", if already in draft_mode.

Note (kls). In a compiled regime, the code for this library must be
compiled with the theory "leadsto" in the ancestry.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

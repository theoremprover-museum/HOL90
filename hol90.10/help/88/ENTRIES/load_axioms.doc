\DOC load_axioms

\TYPE {load_axioms : (string -> void list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in all the axioms from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, then the call
{
   load_axioms `thy`
}
\noindent attempts to load in all the axioms from that theory, that is, for
each axiom {ax}, to perform dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let ax = axiom `thy` `ax`;;
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless {thy} is an ancestor theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_axioms `bool`;;
[(); (); (); (); ()] : void list

SELECT_AX = |- !P x. P x ==> P($@ P)

ETA_AX = |- !t. (\x. t x) = t

IMP_ANTISYM_AX = |- !t1 t2. (t1 ==> t2) ==> (t2 ==> t1) ==> (t1 = t2)

BOOL_CASES_AX = |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F)

ARB_THM = |- $= = $=

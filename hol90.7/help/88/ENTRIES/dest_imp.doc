\DOC dest_imp

\TYPE {dest_imp : (term -> (term # term))}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart an implication (or negation) into antecedent and consequent.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_imp} is a term destructor for implications, which treats negations as
implications with consequent {F}. Thus
{
   dest_imp "t1 ==> t2"
}
\noindent returns
{
   ("t1","t2")
}
\noindent and also
{
   dest_imp "~t"
}
\noindent returns
{
   ("t","F")
}
\FAILURE
Fails with {dest_imp} if term is neither an implication nor a negation.

\COMMENTS
Destructs negations for compatibility with PPLAMBDA code.

@\DOC binders

\TYPE {binders : (string -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Lists the binders in the named theory.

\DESCRIBE
The function {binders} should be applied to a string which is the name of an
ancestor theory (including the current theory; the special string {"-"} is
always interpreted as the current theory). It returns a list of all the binders
declared in the named theory.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theory is an ancestor of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
- binders "bool";
val it = [`$?!`, `$!`, `$@@`] : term list

- binders "prod";
val it = [] : term list
}
\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

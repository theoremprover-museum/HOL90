\chapter{Example: the Binomial Theorem}\label{binomial}

The Binomial Theorem in \HOL{} is a medium sized worked example whose subject 
matter is more widely known than any specific piece of hardware or software. 
This chapter introduces the small amount of algebra and mathematical notation 
needed to state and prove the Binomial Theorem, shows how this is rendered 
in \HOL{}, and outlines the structure of the proof.

This chapter is also available as the self-contained case study \ml{binomial}
in the directory {\small\verb%Training/studies%}.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

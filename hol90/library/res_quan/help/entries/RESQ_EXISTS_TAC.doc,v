@\DOC RESQ_EXISTS_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_EXISTS_TAC : term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips the outermost restricted existential quantifier from
the conclusion of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, restricted quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- ?x::P. t}, the tactic {RESQ_EXISTS_TAC}
reduces it to a new subgoal {A ?- P x' /\ t[x'/x]} where {x'} is a variant
of {x} chosen to avoid clashing with any variables free in the goal's
assumption list. Normally {x'} is just {x}.
{
     A ?- ?x::P. t
   ======================  RESQ_EXISTS_TAC
    A ?- P x' /\ t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is a restricted extistential quantification.

\SEEALSO
RESQ_HALF_EXISTS.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

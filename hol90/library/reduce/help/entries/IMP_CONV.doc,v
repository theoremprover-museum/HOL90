@\DOC IMP_CONV

\TYPE {IMP_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies certain implicational expressions.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} corresponds to one of the forms given below, where {t} is an arbitrary
term of type {bool}, then {IMP_CONV tm} returns the corresponding theorem. Note
that in the last case the antecedent and consequent need only be
alpha-equivalent rather than strictly identical.
{
   IMP_CONV "T ==> t" = |- T ==> t = t
   IMP_CONV "t ==> T" = |- t ==> T = T
   IMP_CONV "F ==> t" = |- F ==> t = T
   IMP_CONV "t ==> F" = |- t ==> F = ~t
   IMP_CONV "t ==> t" = |- t ==> t = T
}

\FAILURE
{IMP_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has one of the forms indicated above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#IMP_CONV "T ==> F";;
|- T ==> F = F

#IMP_CONV "F ==> x";;
|- F ==> x = T

#IMP_CONV "(!z:(num)list. z = z) ==> (!x:(num)list. x = x)";;
|- (!z. z = z) ==> (!x. x = x) = T
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

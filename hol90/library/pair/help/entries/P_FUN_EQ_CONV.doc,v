@\DOC P_FUN_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {P_FUN_EQ_CONV : (term -> conv)}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, extensionality.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Performs extensionality conversion for functions (function equality).

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {P_FUN_EQ_CONV} embodies the fact that two functions are equal
precisely when they give the same results for all values to which they can be
applied. For any paired variable structure {"p"} and equation {"f = g"},
where {p} is of type {ty1} and {f} and {g} are functions of type {ty1->ty2},
a call to {P_FUN_EQ_CONV "p" "f = g"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (f = g) = (!p. f p = g p)
}
\FAILURE
{P_FUN_EQ_CONV p tm} fails if {p} is not a paired structure of variables
or if {tm} is not an equation {f = g} where {f} and {g} are functions.  
Furthermore, if {f} and {g} are functions of type {ty1->ty2},
then the pair {x} must have type {ty1}; otherwise the conversion fails.  
Finally, failure also occurs if any of the variables in {p} is free in either
{f} or {g}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

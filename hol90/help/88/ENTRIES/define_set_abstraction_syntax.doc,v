@\DOC define_set_abstraction_syntax

\TYPE {define_set_abstraction_syntax : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets up an interpretation of set abstraction syntax.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL quotation parser supports the notation {"{{x | P}}"}. This is primarily
intended for use in the {sets} library and dependent work, meaning `the set of
elements {x} such that {P} is true' (presumably {x} will be free in {P}), but
this function allows the interpretation to be changed. A call
{
   define_set_abstraction_syntax `c`
}
\noindent where {c} is a constant of the current theory, will make the
quotation parser interpret
{
   {{x | P}}
}
\noindent as
{
   c (\(x1...xn). (x,P))
}
\noindent where the {x1...xn} are all the variables that occur free in both
{x} or {P}.  The printer will invert this transformation.

\FAILURE
Fails if {c} is not a constant of the current theory.

\COMMENTS
For further details about the use of this function in the {sets} library, refer
to the DESCRIPTION.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {types : (string -> (int # string) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Lists the types in the named theory.

\DESCRIBE
The function {types} should be applied to a string which is the name of an
ancestor theory (including the current theory; the special string {`-`} is
always interpreted as the current theory). It returns a list of all the
type constructors declared in the named theory, in the form of arity-name
pairs.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the named theory is an ancestor.

\EXAMPLE
The theory {HOL} has no types declared:
{
  #types `HOL`;;
  [] : (int # string) list
}
\noindent but its ancestors have the following types declared:
{
   #itlist union (map types (ancestors `HOL`)) [];;
   [(2, `fun`);
    (2, `prod`);
    (0, `bool`);
    (0, `ind`);
    (0, `num`);
    (1, `list`);
    (0, `tree`);
    (1, `ltree`);
    (2, `sum`);
    (0, `one`)]
   : (int # string) list
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

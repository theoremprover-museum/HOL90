\DOC LIST_CONJ

\TYPE {LIST_CONJ : (thm list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Conjoins the conclusions of a list of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
rule, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{
         A1 |- t1 ... An |- tn
   ----------------------------------  LIST_CONJ
    A1 u ... u An |- t1 /\ ... /\ tn
}
\FAILURE
{LIST_CONJ} will fail with {`end_itlist`} if applied to an empty list
of theorems.

\COMMENTS
The system shows the type as {proof}.

{LIST_CONJ} does not check for alpha-equivalence of assumptions when forming
their union. If a particular assumption is duplicated within one of the input
theorems assumption lists, then it may be duplicated in the resulting
assumption list.

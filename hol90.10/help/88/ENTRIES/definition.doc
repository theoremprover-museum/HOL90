\TYPE {definition : (string -> string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reads a constant definition from a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {definition `thy` `def`} returns constant definition {def} from the
theory segment {thy}. The theory segment {thy} must be part of the current
theory. The name {def} is the one given to the definition by the user when it
was originally added to the theory segment (by a call to {new_definition}).
The name of the current theory segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {definition `thy` `def`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not
part of the current theory. It will fail if there does not exist a constant
definition of name {def} in theory segment {thy}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#definition `bool` `ONTO_DEF`;;
|- !f. ONTO f = (!y. ?x. y = f x)
}

@\DOC unhide_constant

\TYPE {unhide_constant : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Restores recognition of a constant by the quotation parser.

\DESCRIBE
A call {unhide_constant `c`}, where {c} is a hidden constant, will unhide the
constant, that is, will make the quotation parser recognize it as such rather
than parsing it as a variable. It reverses the effect of the call
{hide_constant name}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given name is a hidden constant in the current theory.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the constant is
still there in a theory, and may not be redefined.

\SEEALSO
hide_constant.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

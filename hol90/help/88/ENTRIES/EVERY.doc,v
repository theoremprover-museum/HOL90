@\DOC EVERY

\TYPE {EVERY : (tactic list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sequentially applies all the tactics in a given list of tactics.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of tactics {[T1; ... ;Tn]}, and a goal {g}, the tactical
{EVERY} applies each tactic in sequence to every
subgoal generated by the previous one. This can be represented as:
{
   EVERY [T1;...;Tn] = T1 THEN ... THEN Tn
}
\noindent If the tactic list is empty, the resulting tactic has no effect.

\FAILURE
The application of {EVERY} to a tactic list never fails. The resulting
tactic fails iff any of the component tactics do.

\COMMENTS
It is possible to use {EVERY} instead of {THEN}, but probably
stylistically inferior. {EVERY} is more useful when applied to a list of
tactics generated by a function.

\SEEALSO
FIRST, MAP_EVERY, THEN.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

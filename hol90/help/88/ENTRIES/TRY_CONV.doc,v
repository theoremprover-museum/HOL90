@\DOC TRY_CONV

\TYPE {TRY_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to apply a conversion; applies identity conversion in case of failure.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, failure.

\DESCRIBE
{TRY_CONV c "t"} attempts to apply the conversion {c} to the term {"t"}; if
this fails, then the identity conversion applied instead.  That is, if {c} is a
conversion that maps a term {"t"} to the theorem {|- t = t'}, then the
conversion {TRY_CONV c} also maps {"t"} to {|- t = t'}. But if {c} fails when
applied to {"t"}, then {TRY_CONV c "t"} returns {|- t = t}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO
ALL_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

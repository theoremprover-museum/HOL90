\DOC CONJUNCTS_CONV

\TYPE {CONJUNCTS_CONV : ((term # term) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prove equivalence under idempotence, symmetry and associativity of conjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{CONJUNCTS_CONV} takes a pair of terms {"t1"} and {"t2"}, and proves
{|- t1 = t2} if {t1} and {t2} are equivalent up to idempotence, symmetry and
associativity of conjunction.  That is, if {t1} and {t2} are two (different)
arbitrarily-nested conjunctions of the same set of terms, then {CONJUNCTS_CONV
(t1,t2)} returns {|- t1 = t2}. Otherwise, it fails.

\FAILURE
Fails if {t1} and {t2} are not equivalent, as described above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#CONJUNCTS_CONV ("(P /\ Q) /\ R", "R /\ (Q /\ R) /\ P");;
|- (P /\ Q) /\ R = R /\ (Q /\ R) /\ P
}
\USES
Used to reorder a conjunction.  First sort the conjuncts in a term {t1} into
the desired order (e.g. lexicographic order, for normalization) to get a new
term {t2}, then call {CONJUNCTS_CONV(t1,t2)}.

\COMMENTS
This is not a true conversion, so perhaps it ought to be called something else.

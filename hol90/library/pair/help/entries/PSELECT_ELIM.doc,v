@\DOC PSELECT_ELIM

\TYPE {PSELECT_ELIM : (thm -> (term # thm) -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates a paired epsilon term, using deduction from a particular instance.

\DESCRIBE
{PSELECT_ELIM} expects two arguments, a theorem {th1}, and a pair
{(p,th2):(term # thm)}.  The conclusion of {th1} must have the form {P($@@ P)},
which asserts that the epsilon term {$@@ P} denotes some value at which
{P} holds.  The paired variable structure {p} appears only in the assumption
{P p} of the theorem {th2}.  The conclusion of the resulting theorem matches
that of {th2}, and the hypotheses include the union of all hypotheses
of the premises excepting {P p}.
{
    A1 |- P($@@ P)     A2 u {{P p}} |- t
   -------------------------------------  PSELECT_ELIM th1 (p ,th2)
              A1 u A2 |- t
}
\noindent where {p} is not free in {A2}. If {p} appears in the conclusion of
{th2}, the epsilon term will NOT be eliminated, and the conclusion will be
{t[$@@ P/p]}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first theorem is not of the form {A1 |- P($@@ P)}, or if
any of the variables from the variable structure {p} occur free in any
other assumption of {th2}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC RESQ_EXISTS_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_EXISTS_TAC : term -> tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips the outermost restricted existential quantifier from
the conclusion of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, restricted quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- ?x::P. t}, the tactic {RESQ_EXISTS_TAC}
reduces it to a new subgoal {A ?- P x' /\ t[x'/x]} where {x'} is a variant
of {x} chosen to avoid clashing with any variables free in the goal's
assumption list. Normally {x'} is just {x}.
{
     A ?- ?x::P. t
   ======================  RESQ_EXISTS_TAC
    A ?- P x' /\ t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is a restricted extistential quantification.

@\DOC SELECT_CONV

\TYPE {SELECT_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates an epsilon term by introducing an existential quantifier.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, epsilon.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {SELECT_CONV} expects a boolean term of the form
{"P[@@x.P[x]/x]"}, which asserts that the epsilon term {@@x.P[x]} denotes
a value, {x} say, for which {P[x]} holds.  This assertion is equivalent
to saying that there exists such a value, and {SELECT_CONV} applied to a
term of this form returns the theorem {|- P[@@x.P[x]/x] = ?x. P[x]}.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form {"P[@@x.P[x]/x]"}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#SELECT_CONV "(@@n. n < m) < m";;
|- (@@n. n < m) < m = (?n. n < m)
}
\USES
Particularly useful in conjunction with {CONV_TAC} for proving properties
of values denoted by epsilon terms.  For example, suppose that one wishes
to prove the goal
{
   ["0 < m"], "(@@n. n < m) < SUC m"
}
\noindent Using the built-in arithmetic theorem
{
   LESS_SUC  |- !m n. m < n ==> m < (SUC n)
}
\noindent this goal may be reduced by the tactic {MATCH_MP_TAC LESS_SUC} to
the subgoal
{
   ["0 < m"], "(@@n. n < m) < m"
}
\noindent This is now in the correct form for using {CONV_TAC SELECT_CONV} to
eliminate the epsilon term, resulting in the existentially quantified goal
{
   ["0 < m"], "?n. n < m"
}
\noindent which is then straightforward to prove.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

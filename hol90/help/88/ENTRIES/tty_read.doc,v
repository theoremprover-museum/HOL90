@\DOC tty_read

\TYPE {tty_read : (void -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reads a single character from the standard input.

\KEYWORDS
file.

\DESCRIBE
The call {tty_read()} will read a single character from the standard input,
which in an interactive HOL session will normally be the terminal.

\FAILURE
Will only fail under obscure system-dependent circumstances.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows how a check on the deletion of a file might be
implemented:
{
   #tty_write `Delete GONK.th (y/n)?`;
   #tty_read()=`y` => unlink `GONK.th` | ();;
   Delete GONK.th (y/n)?n
   () : void
   Run time: 0.0s
}
\COMMENTS
Only one character is read per call of {tty_read()}, and remaining characters
will be passed to the ML interpreter as usual. It is of course possible to make
multiple calls to {tty_read()} (e.g. via a {while} loop) to read in a longer
string.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

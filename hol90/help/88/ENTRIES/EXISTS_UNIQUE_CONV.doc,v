@\DOC EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV

\TYPE {EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Expands with the definition of unique existence.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, unique.

\DESCRIBE
Given a term of the form {"?!x.P[x]"}, the conversion {EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV}
proves that this assertion is equivalent to the conjunction of two statements,
namely that there exists at least one value {x} such that {P[x]}, and that
there is at most one value {x} for which {P[x]} holds. The theorem returned is:
{
   |- (?! x. P[x]) = (?x. P[x]) /\ (!x x'. P[x] /\ P[x'] ==> (x = x'))
}
\noindent where {x'} is a primed variant of {x} that does not appear free in
the input term.  Note that the quantified variable {x} need not in fact appear
free in the body of the input term.  For example, {EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV "?!x.T"}
returns the theorem:
{
   |- (?! x. T) = (?x. T) /\ (!x x'. T /\ T ==> (x = x'))
}
\FAILURE
{EXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV tm} fails if {tm} does not have the form {"?!x.P"}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC INSTANCE_T_CONV

\TYPE {INSTANCE_T_CONV : ((term -> term list) -> conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function which allows a proof procedure to work on substitution instances of
terms that are in the domain of the procedure.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
This function generalises a conversion that is used to prove formulae true. It
does this by first replacing any syntactically unacceptable subterms with
variables. It then attempts to prove the resulting generalised formula and if
successful it re-instantiates the variables.

The first argument should be a function which computes a list of subterms of a
term which are syntactically unacceptable to the proof procedure. This
function should include in its result any variables that do not appear in
other subterms returned. The second argument is the proof procedure to be
generalised; this should be a conversion which when successful returns an
equation between the argument formula and {T} (true).

\FAILURE
Fails if either of the applications of the argument functions fail, or if the
conversion does not return an equation of the correct form.

\EXAMPLE
{
#FORALL_ARITH_CONV "!f m (n:num). (m < (f n)) ==> (m <= (f n))";;
evaluation failed     FORALL_ARITH_CONV -- formula not in the allowed subset

#INSTANCE_T_CONV non_presburger_subterms FORALL_ARITH_CONV
# "!f m (n:num). (m < (f n)) ==> (m <= (f n))";;
|- (!f m n. m < (f n) ==> m <= (f n)) = T
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC list_mk_exists

\TYPE {list_mk_exists : ((term list # term) -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively constructs existential quantifications.

\DESCRIBE
{list_mk_exists(["x1";...;"xn"],"t")} returns {"?x1 ... xn. t"}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {list_mk_exists} if the terms in the list are not variables or if
{t} is not of type {":bool"} and the list of terms is non-empty. If the list
of terms is empty the type of {t} can be anything.

\COMMENTS
The system shows the type as {(goal -> term)}.

@\DOC print_unquoted_term

\TYPE {print_unquoted_term : (term -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a HOL term to the terminal without surrounding quotes.

\DESCRIBE
{print_unquoted_term tm} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing
the value of {tm} to the terminal without surrounding quotes. The text is not
terminated with a carriage return. In fact, the text is queued until the
pretty-printer decides where line breaks are needed, or until the queue is
explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_unquoted_term "x /\ y";;
x /\ y() : void
}

log

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

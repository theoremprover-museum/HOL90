@\DOC AND_PEXISTS_CONV

\TYPE {AND_PEXISTS_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired existential quantification outwards through a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(?p. t) /\ (?p. u)}, where no
variables in {p} are free in either {t} or {u}, {AND_PEXISTS_CONV} returns
the theorem:
{
   |- (?p. t) /\ (?p. u) = (?p. t /\ u)
}
\FAILURE
{AND_PEXISTS_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{(?p. t) /\ (?p. u)}, or if it is applied to a term {(?p. t) /\ (?p. u)}
in which variables from {p} are free in either {t} or {u}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC preterm_var

\TYPE {preterm_var : (string -> preterm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs variable preterm.

\DESCRIBE
{preterm_var} is analogous to the oft-used ML function {mk_var}.  Since,
however, preterms are untypechecked terms, the restrictions imposed when
using {mk_var} (i.e. that the variable must be either implicitly or
explicitly associated with a specific type) are not encountered until
the preterm is typechecked.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#preterm_var `x`;;
preterm_var `x` : preterm

#preterm_to_term it;;
Indeterminate types:  "x:?"

evaluation failed     types indeterminate

#preterm_typed(preterm_var `x`,":bool");;
preterm_typed((preterm_var `x`), ":bool") : preterm

#preterm_to_term it;;
"x" : term
}

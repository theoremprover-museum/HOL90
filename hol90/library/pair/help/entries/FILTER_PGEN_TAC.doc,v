@\DOC FILTER_PGEN_TAC

\TYPE {FILTER_PGEN_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, selective, quantifier, universal.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Strips off a paired universal quantifier,
but fails for a given quantified pair.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {q} and a goal {A ?- !p. t},
the tactic {FILTER_PGEN_TAC} fails if the quantified pair {p} is the same as
{p}, but otherwise advances the goal in the same way as {PGEN_TAC},
i.e. returns the goal {A ?- t[p'/p]} where {p'} is a variant of {p} chosen to
avoid clashing with any variables free in the goal's assumption list.
Normally {p'} is just {p}.
{
     A ?- !p. t
   ==============  FILTER_PGEN_TAC "q"
    A ?- t[p'/p]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the goal's conclusion is not a paired universal quantifier or the
quantified pair is equal to the given term.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\SYNOPSIS
Strips an explicitly declared theory obligation from a goal, expands it,
and puts the results in the hypotheses.

\DESCRIBE
Removes one explicitly declared theory obligation from a goal
substituting the definition of the theory obligation for the
name.  The abstract object may or may not be universally quantified.  The
theory obligations are placed on the assumption list using
{STRIP_ASSUME_TAC}.

abstract parent has been declared).

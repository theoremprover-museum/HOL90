@\DOC DIV_CONV

\TYPE {DIV_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Calculates by inference the result of dividing, with truncation, one numeral by
another.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{DIV_CONV "m DIV n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m DIV n = s
}
\noindent where {s} is the numeral that denotes the result of dividing the
natural number denoted by {m} by the natural number denoted by {n}, with
truncation.

\FAILURE
{DIV_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m DIV n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals, or if {n} denotes zero.

\EXAMPLE
{
#DIV_CONV "0 DIV 0";;
evaluation failed     DIV_CONV

#DIV_CONV "0 DIV 12";;
|- 0 DIV 12 = 0

#DIV_CONV "2 DIV 0";;
evaluation failed     DIV_CONV

#DIV_CONV "144 DIV 12";;
|- 144 DIV 12 = 12

#DIV_CONV "7 DIV 2";;
|- 7 DIV 2 = 3
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC LEFT_AND_PEXISTS_CONV

\TYPE {LEFT_AND_PEXISTS_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, conjunction.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired existential quantification of the left conjunct outwards
through a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(?p. t) /\ u}, the conversion
{LEFT_AND_PEXISTS_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (?p. t) /\ u = (?p'. t[p'/p] /\ u)
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of the pair {p} that does not 
contains variables free in the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {(?p. t) /\ u}.

\SEEALSO

RIGHT_AND_PEXISTS_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

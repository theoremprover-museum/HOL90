\DOC preterm_to_term

\TYPE {preterm_to_term : (preterm -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a preterm to a HOL term.

\DESCRIBE
Preterms are untypechecked terms, and are included in the HOL system
to allow embedding of special purpose parsers, and to provide a way
of experimenting with other forms of type checking.  {preterm_to_term} is
the hook for pushing preterms through the standard HOL typechecker.

\FAILURE
Fails with the appropriate HOL error message.

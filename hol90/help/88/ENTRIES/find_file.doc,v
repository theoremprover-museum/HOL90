@\DOC find_file

\TYPE {find_file: (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches for a named file.

\DESCRIBE
Searches for a named file using the search path, and returns the full pathname
if successful (if the file is in the current directory, this will just be the
argument string).

\FAILURE
Fails if the named file cannot be found using the current search path.

\EXAMPLE
The answer from the following will depend on where HOL is installed:
{
   #find_file `combin.th`;;
   `/usr/groups/hol/HOL2/sun4_sos/theories/combin.th` : string
}
\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {new_constant : ((string # type) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new constant in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_constant(`c`,":ty")} makes {c} a constant in the current theory.
Note that it does not specify its value. The constant may have a polymorphic
type, which can be used in arbitrary instantiations.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode, or if the name is not a valid constant
name, or there is already a constant of that name in the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#new_theory `zonk`;;
() : void

#new_constant(`graham's_number`,":num");;
() : void
}

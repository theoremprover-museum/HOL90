@\DOC PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_TAC

\TYPE {PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal using a supplied list of theorems, making one
rewriting pass over the goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_TAC} generates a set of rewrites from the given
list of theorems, and applies them at every match found through
searching once over the term part of the goal, without recursing. It
does not include the basic tautologies as rewrite theorems. The order
in which the rewrites are applied is unspecified. For more information
on rewriting tactics see {GEN_REWRITE_TAC}.

\FAILURE
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_TAC} does not fail and does not diverge.

\USES
This tactic is useful when the built-in tautologies are not required
as rewrite equations and recursive rewriting is not desired.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

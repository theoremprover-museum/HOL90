\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a theorem {A |- t},
the inference rule {PGEN} returns the theorem {A |- !p. t}, provided that
no variable in {p} occurs free in the assumptions {A}.
There is no compulsion that the variables of {p} should be free in {t}.
{
      A |- t
   ------------  PGEN "p"               [where p does not occur free in A]
    A |- !p. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {p} is not a paired structure of variables,
of if any variable in {p} is free in the assumptions.

@\DOC FILTER_DISCH_TAC

\TYPE {FILTER_DISCH_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Conditionally moves the antecedent of an implicative goal into the assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, undischarge, antecedent.

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_DISCH_TAC} will move the antecedent of an implication into the
assumptions, provided its parameter does not occur in the antecedent.
{
    A ?- u ==> v
   ==============  FILTER_DISCH_TAC "w"
    A u {{u}} ?- v
}
\noindent Note that {DISCH_TAC} treats {"~u"} as {"u ==> F"}. Unlike
{DISCH_TAC}, the antecedent will be {STRIP}ed into its various components
before being {ASSUME}d. This stripping includes generating multiple goals for
case-analysis of disjunctions. Also, unlike {DISCH_TAC}, should any component
of the discharged antecedent directly imply or contradict the goal, then this
simplification will also be made. Again, unlike {DISCH_TAC}, {FILTER_DISCH_TAC}
will not duplicate identical or alpha-equivalent assumptions.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_DISCH_TAC} will fail if a term which is identical, or alpha-equivalent
to {"w"} occurs free in the antecedent, or if the theorem is not an implication
or a negation.

\COMMENTS
{FILTER_DISCH_TAC "w"} behaves like {FILTER_DISCH_THEN STRIP_ASSUME_TAC "w"}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

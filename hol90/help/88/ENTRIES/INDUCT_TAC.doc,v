@\DOC INDUCT_TAC

\TYPE {INDUCT_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs tactical proof by mathematical induction on the natural numbers.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, induction.

\DESCRIBE
{INDUCT_TAC} reduces a goal {!n.P[n]}, where {n} has type {num}, to two
subgoals corresponding to the base and step cases in a proof by mathematical
induction on {n}. The induction hypothesis appears among the assumptions of the
subgoal for the step case.  The specification of {INDUCT_TAC} is:
{
                A ?- !n. P
    ========================================  INDUCT_TAC
     A ?- P[0/n]     A u {{P}} ?- P[SUC n'/n]
}
\noindent where {n'} is a primed variant of {n} that does not appear free in
the assumptions {A} (usually, {n'} just equals {n}). When {INDUCT_TAC} is
applied to a goal of the form {!n.P}, where {n} does not appear free in {P},
the subgoals are just {A ?- P} and {A u {{P}} ?- P}.

\FAILURE
{INDUCT_TAC g} fails unless the conclusion of the goal {g} has the form {!n.t},
where the variable {n} has type {num}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC top_print

\TYPE {top_print : ((* -> **) -> (* -> **))}

\SYNOPSIS
Allows user-supplied functions to be used for printing ML datatypes
(including types, terms and theorems).

\DESCRIBE
{top_print} is not a proper ML function, but an ML construct. It can only
be used at top-level; otherwise an error will result. The type given above for
it is therefore somewhat bogus. Its argument should normally be a printing
function {f:ty->void}. {top_print f} then instructs the system to use the
function {f} whenever it has a value of type {ty} to print. The `call' to
{top_print} returns {f} as its result.

\FAILURE
Fails if used anywhere other than at top-level.

\EXAMPLE
The following example illustrates how values of an abstract type can be made
to print nicely using {top_print}. For brevity, most of the functions that
would really be defined in the abstract type have been omitted.
{
   #abstype rat = int # int
   #with mk_rat (n,d) = abs_rat (n,d)
   #and print_rat r =
   #       let (n,d) = rep_rat r
   #       in  if (d = 1)
   #           then print_int n
   #           else do (print_int n; print_string `/`; print_int d);;
   mk_rat = - : ((int # int) -> rat)
   print_rat = - : (rat -> void)

   #mk_rat (2,3);;
   - : rat

   #top_print print_rat;;
   - : (rat -> void)

   #mk_rat (2,3);;
   2/3 : rat

   #mk_rat (3,1);;
   3 : rat
}
\USES
Useful for defining the printing of abstract types, including terms, theorems
and types. In particular, calling {top_print} with {print_all_thm} as argument
will cause the hypotheses of theorems to be printed in full, rather than
simply as a period (dot, full-stop).

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

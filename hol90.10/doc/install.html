To build hol90 takes 3 stages:
<OL>
<LI><A HREF = "#Get the hol90 sources">Get the hol90 sources</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#Get SML">Get a Standard ML compiler</A>
<LI><A HREF = "#Make hol90">Make hol90</A>
</OL>

If it happens that you want to move the system after it has been built,
consult <A HREF = "#Moving hol90 after it has been built"> Moving hol90
after it has been built</A>.  If you have any trouble building the
system, please send mail to 
<PRE>
    kxs@cl.cam.ac.uk
</PRE>

<STRONG>Important!</STRONG> Once you have installed the system, all users 
must rebuild any theories (and libraries that build theories) that have 
been built on an earlier release of hol90.

<H1><A NAME = "Get SML">Get a Standard ML Compiler</A></H1>

Currently, hol90 can be built with
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.research.bell-labs.com/dist/smlnj/release/">SML/NJ
110</A>. The New Jersey compiler has a well-deserved
reputation for being memory hungry. You can run hol90 on a 16 Megabyte Sun
workstation, but the more memory the better! A workstation with 24 Megabytes
or more, with generous swap space is recommended.

\DOC help_search_path

\TYPE {help_search_path : (void -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the internal search path use by HOL to find online help files.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {help_search_path()} returns a list of strings representing the
pathnames of the directories that are searched when the {help} function
searches for online help files. Although the help search path can be set to an
arbitrary list of strings, each string is normally expected to be either empty
({``}) or a pathname with `{/}' as its final character.  When the {help}
function looks for an online help file, the directories in the help search path
are searched in the order in which they occur in the list returned by
{help_search_path}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

@\DOC bool_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {bool_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies expressions involving boolean equality.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {bool_EQ_CONV} simplifies equations of the form {t1 = t2},
where {t1} and {t2} are of type {bool}.  When applied to a term of the form
{t = t}, the conversion {bool_EQ_CONV} returns the theorem
{
   |- (t = t) = T
}
\noindent When applied to a term of the form {t = T}, the conversion returns
{
   |- (t = T) = t
}
\noindent And when applied to a term of the form {T = t}, it returns
{
   |- (T = t) = t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless applied to a term of the form {t1 = t2}, where {t1} and {t2} are
boolean, and either {t1} and {t2} are syntactically identical terms or one of
{t1} and {t2} is the constant {T}.

\EXAMPLE
{
    - bool_EQ_CONV (Parse.term_parser `T = F`);
    val it = |- (T = F) = F : thm

    - bool_EQ_CONV (Parse.term_parser `(0 < n) = T`);
    val it = |- (0 < n = T) = 0 < n : thm
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

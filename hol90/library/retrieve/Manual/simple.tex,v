@\section{Simple examples}

This session illustrates some typical uses of the retrieval system.

\setcounter{sessioncount}{1}

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
- load_library_in_place (find_library "retrieve");

Loading the library "retrieve".

The library "retrieve" is loaded.
val it = () : unit
- open Retrieve;

\end{verbatim}\end{session}

First we search for the commutativity of multiplication within the built-in
theories of the \HOL\ system. We want the search\index{searching!steps} to
stop as soon as a matching theorem has been found. However, the search cannot
stop in the middle of a theory.

The pattern\index{patterns!for terms} matches whether or not the theorem is
universally quantified. The variables used in the theorem need not be
{\small\verb%a%} and {\small\verb%b%}. In fact, the pattern will also match
any theorems in which the {\small\verb%a%} and {\small\verb%b%} are replaced
by arbitrary terms of the appropriate type, but such theorems are unlikely to
exist.

The first function call begins the search. Only one theory is examined
initially. The result of the function is a list of theorems found, as well as
a function to continue the search.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
- find_theorems ((--`conc:bool`--) has_body (--`a * b = b * a`--))
=               (Paths [Ancestors (["HOL"],[])]);
Searching theory HOL
val it = Step ([],fn) : searchstep
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent
We now continue\index{searching!continuation} the search until the theorem
required is found:

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
- search_until_find it;
Searching theory restr_binder
Searching theory sum
Searching theory one
Searching theory rec_type
Searching theory bool
Searching theory combin
Searching theory ltree
Searching theory min
Searching theory tree
Searching theory list
Searching theory arithmetic
val it = Step ([(Theorem,"arithmetic","MULT_SYM",|- !m n. m * n = n * m)],fn)
  : searchstep
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent
The output can be disabled by setting \ml{display\_search} to \ml{false}.

More general searches may also be attempted. The next function call searches
for commutative laws which occur in the theory {\small\verb%arithmetic%}.
{\small\verb%C%} is a function in the logic. It is likely that it will match
an infix operator.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
- find_theorems ((--`conc:bool`--)
=                   has_body (--`(C:'a->'a->'b) a b = C b a`--))
=               (Paths [Theory "arithmetic"]);
Searching theory arithmetic
val it =
  Step
    ([(Theorem,"arithmetic","MULT_SYM",|- !m n. m * n = n * m),
      (Theorem,"arithmetic","ADD_SYM",|- !m n. m + n = n + m)],fn)
  : searchstep
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

Theorems concerning a specific operator\index{searching!for operators} can
be obtained, though for many operators the list returned will be very large.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}
- full_search ((--`conc:bool`--) contains (--`>`--))
=             (Paths [Ancestors (["HOL"],[])]);
Searching theory HOL
Searching theory restr_binder
Searching theory sum
Searching theory one
Searching theory rec_type
Searching theory bool
Searching theory combin
Searching theory ltree
Searching theory min
Searching theory tree
Searching theory list
Searching theory arithmetic
Searching theory prim_rec
Searching theory BASIC_HOL
Searching theory num
Searching theory pair
val it =
  [(Definition,"arithmetic","GREATER_OR_EQ",
    |- !m n. m >= n = m > n \/ (m = n)),
   (Definition,"arithmetic","GREATER",|- !m n. m > n = n < m),
   (Theorem,"arithmetic","SUB_RIGHT_GREATER",
    |- !m n p. m - n > p = m > n + p),
   (Theorem,"arithmetic","SUB_LEFT_GREATER",
    |- !m n p. m > n - p = m + p > n /\ m > 0),
   (Theorem,"arithmetic","NOT_GREATER",|- !m n. ~(m > n) = m <= n)]
  : foundthm list
\end{verbatim}\end{session}

\noindent
This is the end of the first session.

\begin{session}\begin{verbatim}

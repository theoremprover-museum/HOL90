\DOC getenv

\TYPE {getenv : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the value of a Unix environment variable.

\DESCRIBE
{getenv x} returns the value of {x} from the current environment list; this
will include shell environment variables set before {HOL} is run.

\FAILURE
If in a Unix environment, fails with {getenv} if the variable is undefined,
or has an empty value. In other environments, it will normally fail anyway.

\EXAMPLE
{
#getenv `SHELL`;;
`/bin/csh` : string
}

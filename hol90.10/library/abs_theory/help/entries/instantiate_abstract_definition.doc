\TYPE {instantiate_abstract_definition : string -> string -> thm -> (term # term) list -> thm}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS 
Instantiates a definition that is made in terms of a definition
from an abstract theory.

\DESCRIBE 
A call of {instantiate_abstract_definition `thy` `th` def
tpl} retrieves the abstract definition {th} from the abstract theory
{thy} rewrites {def} with it and instantiates the result using
{tpl}, where {tpl} is a list of paired terms where the first term is
the variable to be instantiated and the second term is the instantiation.
The abstract theory {thy} must be an ancestor of the current theory.

\FAILURE 
The call will fail if the theory {thy} is not an ancestor of the
current theory.  It will fail if there does not exist a definition {th}
in theory segment {thy}.

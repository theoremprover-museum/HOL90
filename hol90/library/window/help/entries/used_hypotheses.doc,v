@\DOC used_hypotheses

\TYPE {used_hypotheses : (window -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
The used hypotheses of a window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
Those hypotheses of a window that have actually been used in the
transformation of the window.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The set returned by {used_hypotheses} for a given window need not be
a subset of the set returned by {hypotheses} for the same window.
This is because {used_hypotheses} will also contain any conjectures
that have been used in the transformation of the window.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

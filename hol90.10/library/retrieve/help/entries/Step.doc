\DESCRIBE
Searches proceed in steps, one theory segment at a time. At the end of the
search, the theorems found are presented. At intermediate steps, the name of
the theory being searched is displayed. If the search halts after an
intermediate step, a list of theorems found so far and a function to continue
the search are returned by means of the constructor {Step}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

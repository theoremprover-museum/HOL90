\TYPE {save : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Saves an executable version of HOL in its current state.

\DESCRIBE
The call {save `image`} will save an executable core image, called {image}, of
HOL in its current state. This means that if this image is subsequently
executed instead of the normal HOL, any bindings set up will be preserved.

\FAILURE
Will fail only in system-dependent ways, such as running out of disk space.

\COMMENTS
Note that a HOL image is rather large; exactly how large depends on the version
of Lisp and other factors, but it is usually a good many megabytes.

\USES
Avoiding the need to re-execute certain initializations, in particular,
installation, every time HOL is run. Note that a {hol-init.ml} file will be
executed automatically every time HOL is run, and is usually sufficient for
private initializations. See the DESCRIPTION for details.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

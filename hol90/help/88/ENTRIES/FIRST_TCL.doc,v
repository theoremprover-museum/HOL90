@\DOC FIRST_TCL

\TYPE {FIRST_TCL : (thm_tactical list -> thm_tactical)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies the first theorem-tactical in a list which succeeds.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of theorem-tacticals, a theorem-tactic and a theorem,
{FIRST_TCL} returns the tactic resulting from the application of the first
theorem-tactical to the theorem-tactic and theorem which succeeds. The effect
is the same as:
{
   FIRST_TCL [ttl1;...;ttln] = ttl1 ORELSE_TCL ... ORELSE_TCL ttln
}
\FAILURE
{FIRST_TCL} fails iff each tactic in the list fails when applied to the
theorem-tactic and theorem. This is trivially the case if the list is empty.

\SEEALSO
EVERY_TCL, ORELSE_TCL, REPEAT_TCL, THEN_TCL.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

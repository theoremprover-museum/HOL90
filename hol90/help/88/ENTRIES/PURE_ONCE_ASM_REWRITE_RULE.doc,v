@\DOC PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem once, including the theorem's assumptions as rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} excludes the basic tautologies in
{basic_rewrites} from the theorems used for rewriting. It searches for
matching subterms once only, without recursing over already rewritten
subterms. For a general introduction to rewriting tools see
{GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
{PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} does not fail and does not diverge.

\SEEALSO
ASM_REWRITE_RULE, GEN_REWRITE_RULE, ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE,
ONCE_REWRITE_RULE, PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE, PURE_REWRITE_RULE,

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

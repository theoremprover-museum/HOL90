\TYPE {loadt : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
{loadt} loads an ML file with the verbose flag set to {true}.

\DESCRIBE
The function {loadt} takes a string indicating the ML file name as
argument and loads it in the same manner as {load}, except that the
verbose flag is always set to {true}.

\FAILURE
{loadt} will fail if the file named by the argument does not exist in
the search path. It will fail in the same manner if the file is not a
valid ML file. Failure in the ML file will also terminate loading.

\EXAMPLE
If we have an ML file called {foo.ml} which contains the line
{
   let x=2+2;;
}
\noindent this can be loaded as follows:
{
   #loadt `foo.ml`;;
}
\noindent and the system would respond with:
{
   x = 4 : int

   File foo.ml loaded
   () : void
}
\SEEALSO

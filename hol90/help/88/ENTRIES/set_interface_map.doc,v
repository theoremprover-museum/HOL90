@\DOC set_interface_map

\TYPE {set_interface_map : ((string # string) list -> (string # string) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets up a new interface map.

\DESCRIBE
A call {set_interface_map [(a1,c1);...;(an,cn)]}, where the {c}'s are the names
of existing constants, will set up the corresponding interface map, and return
the previous one. This means that a variable or constant with the name {ai}
occurring in a quoted term will be translated into the corresponding {ci}.
Furthermore, if the flag {interface_print} is set, the transformation will be
reversed when terms are printed. For more details of interface maps, refer to
the DESCRIPTION. Note that each call of {set_interface_map} starts from
scratch; it is not possible to augment a previous interface map by a second
call.

\FAILURE
The call will fail if the given map is invalid, for one of the following
reasons: if any of the {c}'s are not the names of existing constants,
or if the map has multiple {c}'s corresponding to a single {a} or vice versa,
or if one of the {a}'s is a constant name which is not redefined by the map
(this would create a confusing interface where two different constants would
have to be printed identically).

\EXAMPLE
{
#set_interface_map[`and`,`/\\`; `or`,`\\/`];;
[] : (string # string) list

#"T and F";;
"T and F" : term

#set_flag(`interface_print`,false);;
true : bool

#"T and F";;
"T /\ F" : term
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

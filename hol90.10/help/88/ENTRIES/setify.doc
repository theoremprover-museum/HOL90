\DOC setify

\TYPE {setify : (* list -> * list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes repeated elements from a list. Makes a list into a `set'.

\DESCRIBE
{setify l} removes repeated elements from {l}, leaving the last occurrence of
each duplicate in the list.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#setify [1;2;3;1;4;3];;
[2; 1; 4; 3] : int list
}
\COMMENTS
Perhaps the first occurrence of each duplicate should be left in the list, not
the last? However, other functions may rely on the ordering currently used.

\SEEALSO
distinct.

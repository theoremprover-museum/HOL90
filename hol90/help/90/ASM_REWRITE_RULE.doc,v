@\DOC ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {ASM_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem including built-in rewrites and the theorem's assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
{ASM_REWRITE_RULE} rewrites with the tautologies in {basic_rewrites},
the given list of theorems, and the set of hypotheses of the theorem. All
hypotheses are used. No ordering is specified among applicable rewrites.
Matching subterms are searched for recursively, starting with the entire term
of the conclusion and stopping when no rewritable expressions remain.  For more
details about the rewriting process, see {GEN_REWRITE_RULE}. To avoid using the
set of basic tautologies, see {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
{ASM_REWRITE_RULE} does not fail, but may result in divergence. To
prevent divergence where it would occur, {ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} can be
used.

\SEEALSO
GEN_REWRITE_RULE, ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE,
PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE, PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE, REWRITE_RULE.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

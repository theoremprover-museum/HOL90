\BLTYPE 
FILTER_ASM_REWRITE_WIN : (term -> bool) -> thm list ->
win_stack -> win_stack
\ELTYPE

\SYNOPSIS
Selectively rewrite the focus with context, theorems, basic rewrites.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} repeatedly rewrites the focus of the
top window on the stack with {thms}, the list of basic rewritings and
those theorems in the context of the window, the conclusions of which
satisfy the predicate {p}.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} will fail if the hypotheses of any of
the theorems in {thms} are not a subset of the conjectures of the
window.  This function may fail to terminate if {thms}, or the
selected terms in the context, describe a circular rewriting.

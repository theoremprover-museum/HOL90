@\DOC UNWIND_ONCE_CONV

\TYPE {UNWIND_ONCE_CONV : ((term -> bool) -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Basic conversion for parallel unwinding of equations defining wire values in a
standard device specification.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{UNWIND_ONCE_CONV p tm} unwinds the conjunction {tm} using the equations
selected by the predicate {p}. {tm} should be a conjunction, equivalent under
associative-commutative reordering to:
{
   t1 /\ t2 /\ ... /\ tn
}
\noindent {p} is used to partition the terms {ti} for {1 <= i <= n} into two
disjoint sets:
{
   REW = {{ti | p ti}}
   OBJ = {{ti | ~p ti}}
}
\noindent The terms {ti} for which {p} is true are then used as a set of
rewrite rules (thus they should be equations) to do a single top-down parallel
rewrite of the remaining terms. The rewritten terms take the place of the
original terms in the input conjunction. For example, if {tm} is:
{
   t1 /\ t2 /\ t3 /\ t4
}
\noindent and {REW = {{t1,t3}}} then the result is:
{
   |- t1 /\ t2 /\ t3 /\ t4 = t1 /\ t2' /\ t3 /\ t4'
}
\noindent where {ti'} is {ti} rewritten with the equations {REW}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#UNWIND_ONCE_CONV (\tm. mem (line_name tm) [`l1`;`l2`])
# "(!(x:num). l1 x = (l2 x) - 1) /\
#  (!x. f x = (l2 (x+1)) + (l1 (x+2))) /\
#  (!x. l2 x = 7)";;
|- (!x. l1 x = (l2 x) - 1) /\
   (!x. f x = (l2(x + 1)) + (l1(x + 2))) /\
   (!x. l2 x = 7) =
   (!x. l1 x = (l2 x) - 1) /\
   (!x. f x = 7 + ((l2(x + 2)) - 1)) /\
   (!x. l2 x = 7)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

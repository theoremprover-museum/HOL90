@\DOC ALPHA

\TYPE {ALPHA : (term -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of alpha-equivalent terms.

\KEYWORDS
rule, alpha.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {t1} and {t1'} which are
alpha-equivalent, {ALPHA} returns the theorem {|- t1 = t1'}.
{

   -------------  ALPHA "t1" "t1'"
    |- t1 = t1'
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the terms provided are alpha-equivalent.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ALPHA "!x:num. x = x" "!y:num. y = y";;
|- (!x. x = x) = (!y. y = y)
}
\COMMENTS
The system shows the type of {ALPHA} as {term -> conv}.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {Compat.setify : ''a list -> ''a list}

\SYNOPSIS
{setify} makes a set out of an "eqtype" list.

\DESCRIBE
{setify l} removes repeated elements from {l}, leaving the last occurrence of
each duplicate in the list.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - setify [1,2,3,1,4,3];
  [2,1,4,3] : int list
}
\COMMENTS
Perhaps the first occurrence of each duplicate should be left in the list, not
the last? However, other functions may rely on the ordering currently used.
Included in {Compat} because {setify} is not found in hol90 ({mk_set} is used 
instead.)

\SEEALSO
distinct.

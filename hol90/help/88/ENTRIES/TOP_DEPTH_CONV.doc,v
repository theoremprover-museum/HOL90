@\DOC TOP_DEPTH_CONV

\TYPE {TOP_DEPTH_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a conversion top-down to all subterms, retraversing changed ones.

\KEYWORDS
conversional.

\DESCRIBE
{TOP_DEPTH_CONV c tm} repeatedly applies the conversion {c} to all the subterms
of the term {tm}, including the term {tm} itself. The supplied conversion {c}
is applied to the subterms of {tm} in top-down order and is applied repeatedly
(zero or more times, as is done by {REPEATC}) at each subterm until it fails.
If a subterm {t} is changed (up to alpha-equivalence) by virtue of the
application of {c} to its own subterms, then then the term into which {t} is
transformed is retraversed by applying {TOP_DEPTH_CONV c} to it.

\FAILURE
{TOP_DEPTH_CONV c tm} never fails but can diverge.

\COMMENTS
The implementation of this function uses failure to avoid rebuilding
unchanged subterms. That is to say, during execution the failure string
{`QCONV`} may be generated and later trapped. The behaviour of the function
is dependent on this use of failure. So, if the conversion given as argument
happens to generate a failure with string {`QCONV`}, the operation of
{TOP_DEPTH_CONV} will be unpredictable.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

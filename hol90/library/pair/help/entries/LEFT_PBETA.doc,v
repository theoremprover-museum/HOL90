\TYPE {LEFT_PBETA : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Beta-reduces a top-level paired beta-redex on the left-hand side of an equation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an equational theorem, {LEFT_PBETA} applies paired
beta-reduction at top level to the left-hand side (only).
Variables are renamed if necessary to avoid free variable capture.
{
    A |- (\x. t1) t2 = s
   ----------------------  LEFT_PBETA
     A |- t1[t2/x] = s
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational, with its left-hand side being
a top-level paired beta-redex.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

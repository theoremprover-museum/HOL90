\SYNOPSIS
Replaces existentially quantified pair with given witness,
and passes it to a theorem-tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{P_PCHOOSE_THEN} expects a pair {q}, a tactic-generating function
{f:thm->tactic}, and a theorem of the form {(A1 |- ?p. u)} as
arguments.  A new theorem is created by introducing the given pair
{q} as a witness for the pair {p} whose existence is asserted in the original
theorem, {(u[q/p] |- u[q/p])}.  If the tactic-generating function {f}
applied to this theorem produces results as follows when applied to a
goal {(A ?- u)}:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  f ({{u[q/p]}} |- u[q/p])
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent then applying {(P_PCHOOSE_THEN "q" f (A1 |- ?p. u))} to the
goal {(A ?- t)} produces the subgoal:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  P_PCHOOSE_THEN "q" f (A1 |- ?p. u)
    A ?- t1         ("q" not free anywhere)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not existentially quantified, or if
the first argument is not a paired structure of variables.  
Failures may arise in the tactic-generating function.  
An invalid tactic is produced if the introduced variable is free in {u} or {t},
or if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an
assumption of the goal.

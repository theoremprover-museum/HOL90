\DOC set_wo_map

\TYPE {set_wo_map : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets interface map for constants in the ``wellorder'' library.

\LIBRARY wellorder

\DESCRIBE
To increase flexibility, the constants used in the wellorder library are
declared with a {wo_} prefix. The {set_wo_map} function sets up an interface
map to eliminate them from view. Any existing interface map is preserved
alongside. The constants which have their prefixes hidden are: {subset},
{Union}, {fl}, {poset}, {chain}, {woset} and {inseg}.

\FAILURE
Fails if an entry in the new interface map clashes with an existing one.

\COMMENTS
The interface map is not set up by default when the library is loaded.

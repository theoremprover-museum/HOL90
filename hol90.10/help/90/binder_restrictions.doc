\DOC binder_restrictions

\TYPE {binder_restrictions : unit -> (string * string) list}

\SYNOPSIS
Shows the list of binder restrictions currently in force.

\DESCRIBE
{associate_restriction} is used to control the parsing and prettyprinting of
restricted binders, which give the illusion of dependent types. The list 
of current restrictions is found by calling {binder_restrictions}. There 
are always at least the following restricted binders: ["!","?","@","\\"].

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
    associate_restriction("DURING","RES_DURING");
    () : unit

    binder_restrictions();
    [("DURING","RES_DURING"),("!","RES_FORALL"),("?","RES_EXISTS"),
     ("@","RES_SELECT"),("\\","RES_ABSTRACT")] : (string * string) list

}

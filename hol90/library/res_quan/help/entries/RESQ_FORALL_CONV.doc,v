@\DOC RESQ_FORALL_CONV

\TYPE {RESQ_FORALL_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a restricted universal quantification to an implication.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, restricted quantifier, universal, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {!x::P. Q}, the conversion
{RESQ_FORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- !x::P. Q = (!x. P x ==> Q)
}
\noindent which is the underlying semantic representation of the restricted
universal quantification.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {!x::P. Q}.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC EXISTS_PMI

\TYPE {EXISTS_PMI : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies the clauses of a backward implication.

\LIBRARY window

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a variable {`x`} and a theorem {A |- t1 <== t2}, the
{EXISTS_PMI} inference rule returns the theorem
{A |- (?x. t1) <== (?x. t2)}, provided {`x`} is not free in the
assumptions.
{
         A |- t1 <== t2
    ------------------------ EXISTS_IMP `x` [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (?x.t1) <== (?x.t2)
}

\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not a backward implication, or if the term is
not a variable, or if the term is a variable but is free in the
assumption list.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC POP_ASSUM_LIST

\TYPE {POP_ASSUM_LIST : ((thm list -> tactic) -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a tactic from the assumptions, discards the assumptions and
applies the tactic.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a function and a goal, {POP_ASSUM_LIST} applies
the function to a list of theorems corresponding to the {ASSUME}d
assumptions of the goal, then applies the resulting tactic to the goal
with an empty assumption list.
{
    POP_ASSUM_LIST f ({{A1;...;An}} ?- t) = f [A1 |- A1; ... ; An |- An] (?- t)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the function fails when applied to the list of {ASSUME}d assumptions,
or if the resulting tactic fails when applied to the goal with no
assumptions.

\COMMENTS
There is nothing magical about {POP_ASSUM_LIST}: the same effect can be
achieved by using {ASSUME a} explicitly wherever the assumption {a} is
used. If {POP_ASSUM_LIST} is used, it is unwise to select elements by
number from the {ASSUME}d-assumption list, since this introduces a dependency
on ordering.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose we have a goal of the following form:
{
   {{a /\ b, c, (d /\ e) /\ f}} ?- t
}
\noindent Then we can split the conjunctions in the assumption list apart by
applying the tactic:
{
   POP_ASSUM_LIST (MAP_EVERY STRIP_ASSUME_TAC)
}
\noindent which results in the new goal:
{
   {{a, b, c, d, e, f}} ?- t
}
\USES
Making more delicate use of the assumption list than simply rewriting or
using resolution.

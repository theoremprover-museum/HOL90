\DOC print_term

\TYPE {print_term : (term -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a HOL term to the terminal.

\DESCRIBE
{print_term tm} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the value
of {tm} to the terminal. The text is not terminated with a carriage return.
In fact, the text is queued until the pretty-printer decides where line breaks
are needed, or until the queue is explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_term "x /\ y";;
"x /\ y"() : void
}

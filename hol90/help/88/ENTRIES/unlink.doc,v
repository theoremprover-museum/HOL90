@\DOC unlink

\TYPE {unlink : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Deletes a file.

\DESCRIBE
If {name} is the name of an existing file, then {unlink `name`} will remove
that file (if there are other links to the file, this will merely remove a
single link). Under Unix, the effect is the same as the {rm} command.

\FAILURE
A call to {unlink} may fail in various system-related ways, in particular if
{name} does not exist or the user does not have write permission for the
current directory.

\COMMENTS
This call is somewhat Unix-related, and may behave differently under other
operating systems.

\SEEALSO
link, system.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

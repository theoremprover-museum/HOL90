@\DOC MOD_CONV

\TYPE {MOD_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Calculates by inference the remainder after dividing one numeral by another.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{MOD_CONV "m MOD n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m MOD n = s
}
\noindent where {s} is the numeral that denotes the remainder after dividing,
with truncation, the natural number denoted by {m} by the natural
number denoted by {n}.

\FAILURE
{MOD_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m MOD n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals, or if {n} denotes zero.

\EXAMPLE
{
#MOD_CONV "0 MOD 0";;
evaluation failed     MOD_CONV

#MOD_CONV "0 MOD 12";;
|- 0 MOD 12 = 0

#MOD_CONV "2 MOD 0";;
evaluation failed     MOD_CONV

#MOD_CONV "144 MOD 12";;
|- 144 MOD 12 = 0

#MOD_CONV "7 MOD 2";;
|- 7 MOD 2 = 1
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

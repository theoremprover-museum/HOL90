\TYPE {PFORALL_OR_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, disjunction.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification inwards through a disjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {!p. t \/ u}, where no variable in {p} is
free in both {t} and {u}, {PFORALL_OR_CONV} returns a theorem of one of three
forms, depending on occurrences of the variables from {p} in {t} and {u}.
If variables from {p} are free in {t} but not in {u}, then the theorem:
{
   |- (!p. t \/ u) = (!p. t) \/ u
}
\noindent is returned.  If variables from {p} are free in {u} but none are
free in {t}, then the result is:
{
   |- (!p. t \/ u) = t \/ (!t. u)
}
\noindent And if no variable from {p} is free in either {t} nor {u},
then the result is:
{
   |- (!p. t \/ u) = (!p. t) \/ (!p. u)
}
\FAILURE
{PFORALL_OR_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{!p. t \/ u}, or if it is applied to a term {!p. t \/ u} in which 
variables from {p} are free in both {t} and {u}.

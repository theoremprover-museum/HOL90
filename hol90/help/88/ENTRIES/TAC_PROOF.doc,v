@\DOC TAC_PROOF

\TYPE {TAC_PROOF : ((goal # tactic) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove a goal using a given tactic.

\KEYWORDS
apply.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal-tactic pair {(A ?- t,tac)}, the {TAC_PROOF} function
attempts to prove the goal {A ?- t}, using the tactic {tac}. If it succeeds, it
returns the theorem {A' |- t} corresponding to the goal, where the assumption
list {A'} may be a proper superset of {A} unless the tactic is valid; there
is no inbuilt validity checking.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal has hypotheses and conclusions all of type {bool},
and the tactic can solve the goal.

\SEEALSO
PROVE, prove_thm, VALID.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

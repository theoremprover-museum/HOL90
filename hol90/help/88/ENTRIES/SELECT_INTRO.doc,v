@\DOC SELECT_INTRO

\TYPE {SELECT_INTRO : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces an epsilon term.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\DESCRIBE
{SELECT_INTRO} takes a theorem with an applicative conclusion, say
{P x}, and returns a theorem with the epsilon term {$@@ P} in place
of the original operand {x}.
{
     A |- P x
   --------------  SELECT_INTRO
    A |- P($@@ P)
}
\noindent The returned theorem asserts that {$@@ P} denotes some value
at which {P} holds.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an application.

\EXAMPLE
Given the theorem
{
   th1 = |- (\n. m = n)m
}
\noindent applying {SELECT_INTRO} replaces the second occurrence of {m} with the
epsilon abstraction of the operator:
{
   #let th2 = SELECT_INTRO th1;;
   th2 = |- (\n. m = n)(@@n. m = n)
}
\noindent This theorem could now be used to derive a further result:
{
   #EQ_MP(BETA_CONV(concl th2))th2;;
   |- m = (@@n. m = n)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

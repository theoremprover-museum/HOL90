@\DOC set_fail

\TYPE {set_fail : (string -> (* -> **) -> * -> **)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specifies the failure string for a function evaluation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a string {s} and a function {f}, the function {set_fail}
gives a function which behaves identically to {f} except that on failure, the
failure string is {s}, regardless of what failure string {f} itself gives rise
to.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows how a failure string can be customized either by
using {set_fail} or by adding a toplevel error trap.
{
   #BETA_CONV "1 + 1";;
   evaluation failed     BETA_CONV

   #(set_fail `Term is not a beta-redex` BETA_CONV) "1 + 1";;
   evaluation failed     Term is not a beta-redex

   #(BETA_CONV "1 + 1") ? failwith `Term is not a beta-redex`;;
   evaluation failed     Term is not a beta-redex
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

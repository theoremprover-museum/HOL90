@\DOC unset_wo_map

\TYPE {unset_wo_map : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes interface map for constants in the ``wellorder'' library.

\LIBRARY wellorder

\DESCRIBE
To increase flexibility, the constants used in the wellorder library are
declared with a {wo_} prefix. The {unset_wo_map} function cancels the effect of
{set_wo_map}, which sets up an interface map to eliminate them from view. Any
existing interface map is preserved when the wellorder-related entries are
eliminated. The constants which have their prefixes hidden are: {subset},
{Union}, {fl}, {poset}, {chain}, {woset} and {inseg}.

\FAILURE
Fails only if some entries in the interface map matching the above have been
set by other means, so if subtracted, a constant would be hidden.

\COMMENTS
The interface map is not set up by default when the library is loaded.

\SEEALSO
interface_map, set_interface_map, set_wo_map.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

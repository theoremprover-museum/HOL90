\TYPE {Compat.last : 'a list -> 'a}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the last element of a list.

\DESCRIBE
{last [x1,...,xn]} returns {xn}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the list is empty.


\COMMENTS
Not in hol90, since it was never used in the implementation. However, 
{Lib.front_n_back} gives the functionality of both {last} and {butlast}.

\SEEALSO
butlast, front_n_back, hd, tl, el, null.

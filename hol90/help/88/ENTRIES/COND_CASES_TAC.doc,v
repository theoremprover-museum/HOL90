@\DOC COND_CASES_TAC

\TYPE {COND_CASES_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Induces a case split on a conditional expression in the goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, conditional, cases.

\DESCRIBE
{COND_CASES_TAC} searches for a conditional sub-term in the term of a goal,
i.e. a sub-term of the form {p=>u|v}, choosing one by its own criteria if there
is more than one. It then induces a case split over {p} as follows:
{
                             A ?- t
    =======================================================  COND_CASES_TAC
     A u {{p}} ?- t[u/(p=>u|v)]   A u {{~p}} ?- t[v/(p=>u|v)]]
}
\noindent where {p} is not a constant, and the term {p=>u|v} is free in {t}.
Note that it both enriches the assumptions and inserts the assumed value into
the conditional.

\FAILURE
{COND_CASES_TAC} fails if there is no conditional sub-term as described above.

\EXAMPLE
For {"x"}, {"y"}, {"z1"} and {"z2"} of type {":*"}, and {"P:*->bool"},
{
   COND_CASES_TAC ([], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)");;
   ([(["P y"], "x = z1"); (["~P y"], "x = z2")], -) : subgoals
}
\noindent but it fails, for example, if {"y"} is not free in the
term part of the goal:
{
   COND_CASES_TAC ([], "!y. x = (P y => z1 | z2)");;
   evaluation failed     COND_CASES_TAC
}
\noindent In contrast, {ASM_CASES_TAC} does not perform the replacement:
{
   ASM_CASES_TAC "P y" ([], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)");;
   ([(["P y"], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)"); (["~P y"], "x = (P y => z1 | z2)")],
    -)
   : subgoals
}
\USES
Useful for case analysis and replacement in one step, when there is a
conditional sub-term in the term part of the goal.  When there is more than
one such sub-term and one in particular is to be analyzed, {COND_CASES_TAC}
cannot be depended on to choose the `desired' one. It can, however, be used
repeatedly to analyze all conditional sub-terms of a goal.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

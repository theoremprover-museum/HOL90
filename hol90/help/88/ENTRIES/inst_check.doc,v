@\DOC inst_check

\TYPE {inst_check : (((type # type) list # term list) -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Checks the validity of type instantiations.

\DESCRIBE
If the {t1...tn} are types (monomorphic or polymorphic), the {v1...vn} type
variables (e.g. {":*"}), and {tm1...tmn} terms, the call
{
   inst_check ([(t1,v1);...;(tn,vn)],[tm1;...;tmn])
}
\noindent will return a list of the variables free in the {tm1...tmn}, provided
none of the type variables {v1...vn} are free in {tm1...tmn}. If this condition
is not met, or any of the {v}'s are not simply type variables, the call fails.

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the {v}'s are not simple type variables, or if any of them are
free in the terms {v1...vn}.

\USES
Checking the validity of type instantiations (for example, if the terms are the
hypotheses of a theorem).

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

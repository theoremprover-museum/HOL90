\TYPE {chktac : (subgoals -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a proof to a list of theorems created using {mk_thm}.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {chktac ([A1,t1;...;An,tn],prf)} applies the proof {prf} to the list
of theorems {[(A1 |- t1);...;(An |- tn)]}.  The list is created by mapping
{mk_thm} down the supplied list of subgoals.

{chktac} is, in fact, an assignable variable in ML, bound when the system is
built to a function that uses {mk_thm} Its presence therefore introduces a
potential insecurity into the system.  But the function {chktac} is used only
by {check_valid} to check the validity of tactics, and users worried about
security can therefore eliminate this insecurity by doing:
{
   chktak := \(gl,prf). fail
}
\noindent This will disable the validity checking of tactics (using {VALID}),
but will remove the insecurity.

\FAILURE
Never fails (unless the proof {prf} fails).

\SEEALSO
check_valid, VALID.

\TYPE {PGEN : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a theorem {A |- t},
the inference rule {PGEN} returns the theorem {A |- !p. t}, provided that
no variable in {p} occurs free in the assumptions {A}.
There is no compulsion that the variables of {p} should be free in {t}.
{
      A |- t
   ------------  PGEN "p"               [where p does not occur free in A]
    A |- !p. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {p} is not a paired structure of variables,
of if any variable in {p} is free in the assumptions.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

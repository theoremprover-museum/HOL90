\TYPE {SPECL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes zero or more variables in the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term list {[u1;...;un]} and a theorem
{A |- !x1...xn. t}, the inference rule {SPECL} returns the theorem
{A |- t[u1/x1]...[un/xn]}, where the substitutions are made
sequentially left-to-right in the same way as for {SPEC}, with the same
sort of alpha-conversions applied to {t} if necessary to ensure that no
variables which are free in {ui} become bound after substitution.
{
       A |- !x1...xn. t
   --------------------------  SPECL "[u1;...;un]"
     A |- t[u1/x1]...[un/xn]
}
\noindent It is permissible for the term-list to be empty, in which case
the application of {SPECL} has no effect.

\FAILURE
Fails unless each of the terms is of the same as that of the 
appropriate quantified variable in the original theorem.

\EXAMPLE
The following is a specialization of a theorem from theory {arithmetic}.
{
   #let t = theorem `arithmetic` `LESS_EQ_LESS_EQ_MONO`;;
   t = |- !m n p q. m <= p /\ n <= q ==> (m + n) <= (p + q)

   #SPECL ["1"; "2"; "3"; "4"] t;;
   |- 1 <= 3 /\ 2 <= 4 ==> (1 + 2) <= (3 + 4)
}

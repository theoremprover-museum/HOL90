\TYPE {new_abstract_representation : string -> (string # type) list -> thm}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new abstract representation.

\DESCRIBE
A call to {new_abstract_representation name decl} creates a new abstract
structure with the name {name} using the declaration list {decl}, where
{decl} is a list of string--type pairs giving the name and type of the
constituent abstract objects.  
The structure name, {name}, is used as the constructor when building
representations. 
The returned theorem is used by the function {abs_type_info}.

\FAILURE
Fails if any of the names have been used in the theory segment.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

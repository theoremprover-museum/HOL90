rule, quantifier, universal, equality.

\SYNOPSIS
Universally quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p}
and a theorem
{
    A |- t1 = t2
}
whose conclusion is an equation between boolean terms:
{
    PFORALL_EQ
}
returns the theorem:
{
    A |- (!p. t1) = (!p. t2)
}
unless any of the variables in {p} is free in any of the assumptions.
{
          A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------------  PFORALL_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
    A |- (!p. t1) = (!p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not an equation between boolean terms, or if the
supplied term is not a paired structure of variables, or if any of the
variables in the supplied pair is free in any of the assumptions.

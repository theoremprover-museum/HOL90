@\DOC PBETA_RULE

\TYPE {PBETA_RULE : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Beta-reduces all the paired beta-redexes in the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t}, the inference rule {PBETA_RULE} beta-reduces
all beta-redexes, at any depth, in the conclusion {t}. Variables are renamed
where necessary to avoid free variable capture.
{
    A |- ....((\p. s1) s2)....
   ----------------------------  BETA_RULE
      A |- ....(s1[s2/p])....
}
\FAILURE
Never fails, but will have no effect if there are no paired beta-redexes.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

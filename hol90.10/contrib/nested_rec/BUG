Dear Elsa,

There appears to be a bug in the nested_rec contribution distributed with
hol90.7. When none of the types being defined appear on the right-hand sides
of the type equations the exception Substring is raised. Examples e0, e1 and
e2 in e1.sml fail.

I think the exception is raised at lines 27-29 of make_type_op.sml due to
RecursorThms.tyop_prefix being an empty string. This in turn can be traced
back to lines 129-130 of def_type.sml, which produces an empty string when
StringTable.elts(constrs) is a null list. One solution appears to be to
change this application to StringTable.elts(defs), i.e., to use the type
names appearing on the left of the type equations rather than on the right,
but I don't understand the intention of the code sufficiently to know whether
this is reasonable. The change allows examples e1 and e2 to succeed, but e0
still fails due to num_Axiom (an irrelevant recursor theorem) having no type
variables.

If you have time could you indicate whether my bug fix seems reasonable.

Richard.

@\DOC PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem including the theorem's assumptions as rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
The list of theorems supplied by the user and the assumptions of the
object theorem are used to generate a set of rewrites, without adding
implicitly the basic tautologies stored under {basic_rewrites}.
The rule searches for matching subterms in a top-down recursive
fashion, stopping only when no more rewrites apply. For a general
description of rewriting strategies see {GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
Rewriting with {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} does not result in failure. It
may diverge, in which case {PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} may be used.

\SEEALSO
ASM_REWRITE_RULE, GEN_REWRITE_RULE, ONCE_REWRITE_RULE,
PURE_REWRITE_RULE, PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

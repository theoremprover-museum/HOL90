@\DOC DISJ_CASES_THEN2

\TYPE {DISJ_CASES_THEN2 : (thm_tactic -> thm_tactical)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies separate theorem-tactics to the two disjuncts of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, disjunction, cases.

\DESCRIBE
If the theorem-tactics {f1} and {f2}, applied to the {ASSUME}d left and right
disjunct of a theorem {|- u \/ v} respectively, produce results as follows when
applied to a goal {(A ?- t)}:
{
    A ?- t                                 A ?- t
   =========  f1 (u |- u)      and        =========  f2 (v |- v)
    A ?- t1                                A ?- t2
}
\noindent then applying {DISJ_CASES_THEN2 f1 f2 (|- u \/ v)} to the
goal {(A ?- t)} produces two subgoals.
{
           A ?- t
   ======================  DISJ_CASES_THEN2 f1 f2 (|- u \/ v)
    A ?- t1      A ?- t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not a disjunction.  An invalid tactic is
produced if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not
alpha-convertible to an assumption of the goal.

\EXAMPLE
Given the theorem
{
   th = |- (m = 0) \/ (?n. m = SUC n)
}
\noindent and a goal of the form {?- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0)},
applying the tactic
{
   DISJ_CASES_THEN2 SUBST1_TAC ASSUME_TAC th
}
\noindent to the goal will produce two subgoals
{
   ?n. m = SUC n ?- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0)

   ?- (PRE 0 = 0) = (0 = 0)
}
\noindent The first subgoal has had the disjunct {m = 0} used
for a substitution, and the second has added the disjunct to the
assumption list.  Alternatively, applying the tactic
{
   DISJ_CASES_THEN2 SUBST1_TAC (CHOOSE_THEN SUBST1_TAC) th
}
\noindent to the goal produces the subgoals:
{
   ?- (PRE(SUC n) = SUC n) = (SUC n = 0)

   ?- (PRE 0 = 0) = (0 = 0)
}
\USES
Building cases tacticals. For example, {DISJ_CASES_THEN} could be defined by:
{
  let DISJ_CASES_THEN f = DISJ_CASES_THEN2 f f
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

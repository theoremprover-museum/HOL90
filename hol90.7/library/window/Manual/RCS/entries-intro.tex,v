This chapter provides documentation on most of the \ML\ functions that are made
available in \HOL\ when the \ml{window} library is loaded. This documentation
is also available online via the \ml{help} facility.
The documentation does not extend to functions which are 
considered to be {\it internal\/} to the \ml{window} library.
Entries for the internal functions do appear in the online help.

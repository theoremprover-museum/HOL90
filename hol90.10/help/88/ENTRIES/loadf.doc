\TYPE {loadf : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads an ML file with the verbose flag set to {false}.

\DESCRIBE
The function {loadf} takes a string indicating the ML file name as
argument and loads it in the same manner as {load}, except that the
verbose flag is always set to false.

\FAILURE
{loadf} will fail if the file named by the argument does not exist in
the search path. It will fail in the same manner if the file is not a
valid  ML file. Failure in the ML file will terminate loading.

\EXAMPLE
If we have a ML file called {foo.ml} which contains the line
{
   let x=2+2;;
}
\noindent this can be loaded as follows:
{
   #loadf `foo.ml`;;
}
\noindent and the system would respond with:
{
   .() : void
}
\SEEALSO
load, loadf.

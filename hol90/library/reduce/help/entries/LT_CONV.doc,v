@\DOC LT_CONV

\TYPE {LT_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves result of less-than ordering on two numerals.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are both numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{LT_CONV "m < n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (m < n) = T
}
\noindent if the natural number denoted by {m} is less than that denoted by
{n}, or
{
   |- (m < n) = F
}
\noindent otherwise.

\FAILURE
{LT_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form {"m < n"}, where {m} and {n}
are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#LT_CONV "0 < 12";;
|- 0 < 12 = T

#LT_CONV "13 < 13";;
|- 13 < 13 = F

#LT_CONV "25 < 12";;
|- 25 < 12 = F
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

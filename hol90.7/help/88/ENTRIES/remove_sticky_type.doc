\TYPE {remove_sticky_type : (string -> type)}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes a sticky type from a given variable.

\DESCRIBE
A call {remove_sticky_type name} will remove any sticky type from {name},
whether this was inferred automatically as a result of the setting of the
{sticky} flag, or given explicitly by the {set_sticky_type} function. It
returns the sticky type which was associated with that name. For more
details of the sticky type mechanism, refer to the DESCRIPTION.

\FAILURE
Fails if the name was not associated with a sticky type.

@\DOC CONJUNCTS_CONV

\TYPE {CONJUNCTS_CONV : ((term # term) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prove equivalence under idempotence, symmetry and associativity of conjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{CONJUNCTS_CONV} takes a pair of terms {"t1"} and {"t2"}, and proves
{|- t1 = t2} if {t1} and {t2} are equivalent up to idempotence, symmetry and
associativity of conjunction.  That is, if {t1} and {t2} are two (different)
arbitrarily-nested conjunctions of the same set of terms, then {CONJUNCTS_CONV
(t1,t2)} returns {|- t1 = t2}. Otherwise, it fails.

\FAILURE
Fails if {t1} and {t2} are not equivalent, as described above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#CONJUNCTS_CONV ("(P /\ Q) /\ R", "R /\ (Q /\ R) /\ P");;
|- (P /\ Q) /\ R = R /\ (Q /\ R) /\ P
}
\USES
Used to reorder a conjunction.  First sort the conjuncts in a term {t1} into
the desired order (e.g. lexicographic order, for normalization) to get a new
term {t2}, then call {CONJUNCTS_CONV(t1,t2)}.

\COMMENTS
This is not a true conversion, so perhaps it ought to be called something else.

\SEEALSO
CONJ_SET_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

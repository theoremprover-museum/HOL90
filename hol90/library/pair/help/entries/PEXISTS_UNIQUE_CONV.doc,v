@\DOC PEXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV

\TYPE {PEXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, unique.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Expands with the definition of paired unique existence.

\DESCRIBE
Given a term of the form {"?!p. t[p]"}, the conversion {PEXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV}
proves that this assertion is equivalent to the conjunction of two statements,
namely that there exists at least one pair {p} such that {t[p]}, and that
there is at most one value {p} for which {t[p]} holds. The theorem returned is:
{
   |- (?!p. t[p]) = (?p. t[p]) /\ (!p p'. t[p] /\ t[p'] ==> (p = p'))
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of the pair {p} none of the components
of which appear free in the input term.  Note that the quantified pair {p}
need not in fact appear free in the body of the input term.  
For example, {PEXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV "?!(x,y). T"}
returns the theorem:
{
   |- (?!(x,y). T) =
      (?(x,y). T) /\ (!(x,y) (x',y'). T /\ T ==> ((x,y) = (x',y')))
}
\FAILURE
{PEXISTS_UNIQUE_CONV tm} fails if {tm} does not have the form {"?!p.t"}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

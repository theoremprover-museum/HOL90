@\DOC delete_thm

\TYPE {delete_thm : (string -> string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Deletes a theorem from a theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is an ancestor theory, and {th} the name of a theorem of that theory,
then the call
{
   delete_thm `thy` `th`
}
\noindent will delete the theorem {th} from the theory {thy}. As usual, the
special string {`-`} is allowed as a theory name, standing for the current
theory. The call will return the theorem deleted.

\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {th} is not one of its
theorems, or for various system-dependent reasons connected with writing to the
theory file.

\EXAMPLE
{
#new_theory `geek`;;
() : void

#theorems `-`;;
[] : (string # thm) list

#save_thm(`truth`,TRUTH);;
|- T

#theorems `-`;;
[(`truth`, |- T)] : (string # thm) list

#delete_thm `-` `truth`;;
|- T

#theorems `-`;;
[] : (string # thm) list
}
\COMMENTS
The particular theorems which are stored in a theory have no logical
significance, so this operation is quite safe. By contrast, being able to
delete a definition from a theory would compromise the consistency of the
logic, so it is not allowed.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

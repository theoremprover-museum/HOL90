\TYPE {thmname : (string -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a pattern for testing the name of a theorem.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
{thmname s} returns a pattern that matches a theorem if and only if the
string {s} when interpreted as a pattern for names matches the name of the
theorem. The string is used as a pattern in which {*} is interpreted as
`match any number of characters (including none)' and {?} is interpreted as
`match any single character'. All other characters in the string are taken
literally.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

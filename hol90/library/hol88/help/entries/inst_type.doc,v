\TYPE {Compat.inst_type : (hol_type * hol_type) list -> hol_type -> hol_type}

\SYNOPSIS
Instantiates types in a type.

\DESCRIBE
If {[(t1',t1),...,(tn',tn)]} is a list of type instantiations, where {t1...tn}
are the initial types, and {t1'...tn'} the desired instantiations, and {ty} is
a type to instantiate, the call
{
   inst_type [(t1',t1),...,(tn',tn)] ty
}
\noindent will appropriately instantiate the type {ty}. The
instantiations will be performed in parallel. If several of the type
instantiations are applicable, the choice is undefined. The {t1...tn}
need not be type variables, but those that aren't will not be
substituted for. Neither is it necessary that any or all of the types
{t1...tn} should in fact appear in {ty}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - inst_type [((==`:bool`==),(==`:'a`==))] (==`:'a # 'b`==);
  (==`:bool # 'b`==) : hol_type

  - inst_type [((==`:num`==),(==`:'a # 'b`==)),((==`:bool`==),(==`:'a`==))] 
              (==`:'a # 'b`==);
  (==`:bool # 'b`==) : hol_type

}

\COMMENTS
Not in hol90, since the author decided that {type_subst} was a better name.
{inst_type} and {type_subst} have different types, but modulo that, they
perform identically.

    - type_subst;
    val it = fn : hol_type subst -> hol_type -> hol_type

\SEEALSO
type_subst, inst, INST_TYPE.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

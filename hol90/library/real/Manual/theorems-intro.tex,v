@\label{theorems}

The sections that follow list all theorems in the \ml{reals} library,
including definitions. The theorems are grouped into their theories, which
corresponds quite closely to a natural logical partitioning. When the
\ml{reals} library is loaded, only theorems in {\tt REAL} and {\tt TRANSC} are
set up to autoload (and not all of them). These should be all the theorems
needed for day-to-day use of the library. Other definitions and theorems may,
if desired, be recovered by using the \ml{defintion} and \ml{theorem} functions
provided by \ML. Note that all theorems are printed with the interface map set
up as done by the library. In addition the symbol {\tt -->} is used for the
constants {\tt tends\_num\_real} and {\tt tends\_real\_real} in the theories
{SEQ} and {LIM} respectively.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {check_valid : (goal -> subgoals -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Checks whether a prospective proof is valid.

\DESCRIBE
{check_valid (A,t) ([A1,t1;...;An,tn],prf)} checks whether the applying the
proof {prf} to the list of theorems {[(A1 |- t1);...;(An |- tn)]} would produce
a theorem alpha-equivalent to {A |- t}. This check is done by creating this
list of theorems using {chktac} and then applying the proof {prf}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, unless the proof {prf} fails or the assignable variable {chktac}
has been rebound to a function that fails.

\SEEALSO

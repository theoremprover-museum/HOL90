\DOC set_thm_count

\TYPE {set_thm_count : (int -> int)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets the theorem-counter to the given value.

\DESCRIBE
HOL maintains a counter which is incremented every time a primitive inference
is performed (including when an axiom or definition set up). A call to
{set_thm_count} sets the counter to a particular value, returning the previous
value.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO
thm_count, timer.

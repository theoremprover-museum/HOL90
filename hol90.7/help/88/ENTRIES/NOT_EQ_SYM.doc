\DOC NOT_EQ_SYM

\TYPE {NOT_EQ_SYM : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Swaps left-hand and right-hand sides of a negated equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, symmetry, equality, negation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- ~(t1 = t2)}, the inference rule {NOT_EQ_SYM}
returns the theorem {A |- ~(t2 = t1)}.
{
    A |- ~(t1 = t2)
   -----------------  NOT_EQ_SYM
    A |- ~(t2 = t1)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem's conclusion is a negated equation.

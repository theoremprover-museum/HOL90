@\DOC DISJ_CASES_THENL

\TYPE {DISJ_CASES_THENL : (thm_tactic list -> thm_tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies theorem-tactics in a list to the corresponding disjuncts in a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, disjunction, cases.

\DESCRIBE
If the theorem-tactics {f1...fn} applied to the {ASSUME}d disjuncts of a
theorem
{
   |- d1 \/ d2 \/...\/ dn
}
\noindent produce results as follows when applied to a goal {(A ?- t)}:
{
    A ?- t                                A ?- t
   =========  f1 (d1 |- d1) and ... and =========  fn (dn |- dn)
    A ?- t1                              A ?- tn
}
\noindent then applying {DISJ_CASES_THENL [f1;...;fn] (|- d1 \/...\/ dn)}
to the goal {(A ?- t)} produces n subgoals.
{
           A ?- t
   =======================  DISJ_CASES_THENL [f1;...;fn] (|- d1 \/...\/ dn)
    A ?- t1  ...  A ?- tn
}
\noindent {DISJ_CASES_THENL} is defined using iteration, hence for
theorems with more than {n} disjuncts, {dn} would itself be disjunctive.

\FAILURE
Fails if the number of tactic generating functions in the list exceeds
the number of disjuncts in the theorem.  An invalid tactic is
produced if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not
alpha-convertible to an assumption of the goal.

\USES
Used when the goal is to be split into several cases, where a
different tactic-generating function is to be applied to each case.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC ml_curried_infix

\TYPE {ml_curried_infix : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares an ML identifier to have infix status (for curried functions).

\DESCRIBE
{ml_curried_infix `string`} declares to the ML parser that {string} has infix
status. The identifier {string} should be bound to a curried function.

\FAILURE
Only ordinary identifiers and certain single character, non-digit, non-layout
strings can be used as infixes. An attempt to infix other strings may fail,
or it may succeed but have unpredictable effects on the parser.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ml_curried_infix `plus`;;
() : void

#let x plus y = x + y;;
plus = - : (int -> int -> int)

#1 plus 2;;
3 : int
}

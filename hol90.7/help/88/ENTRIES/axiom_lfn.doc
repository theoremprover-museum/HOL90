\DOC axiom_lfn

\TYPE {axiom_lfn : (string list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads a given axiom from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is an ancestor theory, and {ax} one of its axioms, then the call
{
   axiom_lfn [`thy`;`ax`]
}
\noindent will return that axiom.

\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {ax} is not one of its
axioms.

\EXAMPLE
{
#axiom_lfn [`bool`;`ETA_AX`];;
|- !t. (\x. t x) = t
}
\COMMENTS
This call has the same effect as {axiom `thy` `ax`}.

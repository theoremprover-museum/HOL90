@\DOC FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : ((term -> bool) -> thm list -> thm ->thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem with some of the theorem's assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
rule, selective.

\DESCRIBE
This function implements selective rewriting with a subset of the assumptions
of the theorem. The first argument (a predicate on terms) is applied to all
assumptions, and the ones which return {true} are used to rewrite the goal.
See {GEN_REWRITE_RULE} for more information on rewriting.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} does not fail.
Using {FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} may result in a diverging sequence of
rewrites. In such cases {FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE} may be used.

\USES
This rule can be applied when rewriting with all assumptions results in
divergence. Typically, the predicate can model checks as to whether a certain
variable appears on the left-hand side of an equational assumption, or whether
the assumption is in disjunctive form.

Another use is to improve performance when there are many assumptions
which are not applicable. Rewriting, though a powerful method of
proving theorems in HOL, can result in a reduced performance due to
the pattern matching and the number of primitive inferences involved.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

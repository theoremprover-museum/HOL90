\DOC X_SKOLEM_CONV

\TYPE {X_SKOLEM_CONV : (term -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces a user-supplied Skolem function.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
{X_SKOLEM_CONV} takes two arguments.  The first is a variable {f}, which
must range over functions of the appropriate type, and the second is a term of
the form {!x1...xn. ?y. P}.  Given these arguments, {X_SKOLEM_CONV} returns
the theorem:
{
   |- (!x1...xn. ?y. P) = (?f. !x1...xn. tm[f x1 ... xn/y])
}
\noindent which expresses the fact that a skolem function {f} of the
universally quantified variables {x1...xn} may be introduced in place of the
the existentially quantified value {y}.

\FAILURE
{X_SKOLEM_CONV f tm} fails if {f} is not a variable, or if the input term {tm}
is not a term of the form {!x1...xn. ?y. P}, or if the variable {f} is free in
{tm}, or if the type of {f} does not match its intended use as an {n}-place
curried function from the variables {x1...xn} to a value having the same type
as {y}.

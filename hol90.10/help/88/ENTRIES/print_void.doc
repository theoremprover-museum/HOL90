\DOC print_void

\TYPE {print_void : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints `{()}' to the terminal.

\DESCRIBE
{print_void ()} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the value
`{()}' to the terminal. The text is not terminated with a carriage return.
In fact, the text is queued until the pretty-printer decides where line breaks
are needed, or until the queue is explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_void();;
()() : void
}
\SEEALSO
print_begin, print_end, print_newline.

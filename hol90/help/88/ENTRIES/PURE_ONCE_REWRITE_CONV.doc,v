@\DOC PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV

\TYPE {PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV : (thm list -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a term once with only the given list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
{PURE_ONCE_REWRITE_CONV} generates rewrites from the list of theorems
supplied by the user, without including the tautologies given in
{basic_rewrites}. The applicable rewrites are employeded once, without
entailing in a recursive search for matches over the term.
See {GEN_REWRITE_CONV} for more details about rewriting strategies in
HOL.

\FAILURE
This rule does not fail, and it does not diverge.

\SEEALSO
GEN_REWRITE_CONV, ONCE_DEPTH_CONV,
ONCE_REWRITE_CONV, PURE_REWRITE_CONV, REWRITE_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

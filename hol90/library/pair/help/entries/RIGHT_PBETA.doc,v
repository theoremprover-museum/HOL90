@\DOC RIGHT_PBETA

\TYPE {RIGHT_PBETA : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Beta-reduces a top-level paired beta-redex on the right-hand side of an 
equation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an equational theorem, {RIGHT_PBETA} applies paired
beta-reduction at top level to the right-hand side (only).
Variables are renamed if necessary to avoid free variable capture.
{
    A |- s = (\p. t1) t2
   ----------------------  RIGHT_PBETA
     A |- s = t1[t2/p]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational, with its right-hand side being
a top-level paired beta-redex.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

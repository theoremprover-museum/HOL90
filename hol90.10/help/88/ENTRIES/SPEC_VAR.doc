\DOC SPEC_VAR

\TYPE {SPEC_VAR : (thm -> (term # thm))}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem, returning the chosen variant.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x. t}, the inference rule {SPEC_VAR} returns
the term {x'} and the theorem {A |- t[x'/x]}, where {x'} is a variant
of {x} chosen to avoid free variable capture.
{
     A |- !x. t
   --------------  SPEC_VAR
    A |- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem's conclusion is universally quantified.

\COMMENTS
This rule is very similar to plain {SPEC}, except that it returns the
variant chosen, which may be useful information under some circumstances.

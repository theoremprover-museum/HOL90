| DOCUMENTATION:							|
|									|
+ --------------------------------------------------------------------- +

This library contains a basic theory of traces for CSP, as described in
"Communicating Sequential Processes", Hoare C.A.R., Prentice-Hall.

The theories are still unpolished and uncommented.

\DOC is_imp

\TYPE {is_imp : (term -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests a term to see if it is an implication (or a negation).

\DESCRIBE
{is_imp "t1 ==> t2"} returns {true}. {is_imp "~t"} returns {true}.
If the term is neither an implication nor a negation the result is {false}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
Yields true of negations because {dest_imp} destructs negations (for
compatibility with PPLAMBDA code).

\SEEALSO
mk_imp, dest_imp.

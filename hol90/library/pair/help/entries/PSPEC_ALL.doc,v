\TYPE {PSPEC_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with its own quantified pairs.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p1...pn. t}, the inference rule {PSPEC_ALL}
returns the theorem {A |- t[p1'/p1]...[pn'/pn]} where the {pi'} are distinct
variants of the corresponding {pi}, chosen to avoid clashes with any variables
free in the assumption list and with the names of constants. Normally {pi'} is
just {pi}, in which case {PSPEC_ALL} simply removes all universal quantifiers.
{
       A |- !p1...pn. t
   ---------------------------  PSPEC_ALL
    A |- t[p1'/x1]...[pn'/xn]
}
\FAILURE
Never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

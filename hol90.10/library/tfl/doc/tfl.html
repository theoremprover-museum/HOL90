<H1>TFL User Manual</H1>

This document describes the <STRONG>TFL</STRONG> system and how one can
use it. <STRONG>TFL</STRONG>, which stands for <STRONG>T</STRONG>otal
<STRONG>F</STRONG>unctional <STRONG>L</STRONG>anguage, is a verification
system for higher-order polymorphic functional programs, much like those
of ML or Haskell, with one special property: each program must
terminate. <STRONG>TFL</STRONG> models programs with the native
functions of a higher order logic; this has the advantage that the
built-in reasoning machinery for functions can be directly applied to
reasoning about programs, <EM>i.e.</EM>, no special verification theory
has to be built.

<H2>Using an instantiation of <STRONG>TFL</STRONG></H2>

In order use use an instantiation of <STRONG>TFL</STRONG>, one must know
the language allowed to express recursive definitions in. There are two
components of this: how to express the recursion equations, and how to
express termination.

<H3>Recursion Equations</H3>

Function definitions are very much like those of ML, with the
restriction that patterns must be exhaustive, and must be presented as a
single argument. This means that equations like the following are
allowed:

<PRE>
    f x = if (x=0) then 1 else x * f(x-1)

    ack (0,n) =  n+1
    ack (Suc m,0) = ack (m, 1)
    ack (Suc m, Suc n) = ack (m, ack (Suc m, n))
</PRE>

but that the following are not (the first two have overlapping patterns,
and the second function has two arguments):

<PRE>
    g (0,x) = 1
    g (y,0) = 2

    f 0 = 1
    f y = y * f (x-1)

                A 0 n = n+1
          A (Suc m) 0 = A m 1
    A (Suc m) (Suc n) = A m (A (Suc m) n)
</PRE>

<H3>Expressing Termination</H3>

Termination expressions are built out of wellfounded relations. A
wellfounded relation is one that "allows no infinite decreasing
chains". Consider an arbitrary invocation <EM>f x</EM> of a function
<EM>f</EM>, leading to recursive calls <EM>f y_1</EM>,...,<EM>f
y_m</EM>. If we can place <EM>(y_1,x), ..., (y_m,x)</EM> in a
wellfounded relation, then <EM>f</EM> terminates. Thus our job involves
<EM>finding</EM> wellfounded relations and <EM>proving</EM> termination,
<EM>i.e.</EM>, that recursive calls belong in the selected wellfounded
relation. 

<P>

Fortunately, it is usually simple to build the right wellfounded
relation. The basic wellfounded relation for a datatype is the
<EM>immediate subterm</EM> relation. This is wellfounded since one can
only finitely often take the immediate subterm of a datatype element
before getting to a term with no subterms. For example, in the natural
numbers, the predecessor relation is the immediate subterm relation.
Using the immediate subterm relation for a datatype gives <EM>primitive
recursive</EM> definitions, but we can make much more powerful
termination expressions by use of the following combining forms:
transitive closure, inverse image, and lexicographic combination (there
are others available, but these are the most useful). Following are the
definitions:

<PRE>
   inv_image R f = \x y. R (f x) (f y))

   lexico R1 R2 = \(s,t) (u,v). R1 s u \/ (s = u) /\ R2 t v)

   measure = inv_image (&lt;)
</PRE>  

Now we give some example termination expressions and describe what
functions would terminate under them.

<UL>
<LI><EM>\x y.y = Suc x</EM>. This is one way to express the predecessor
    relation, and it proves that such functions as factorial terminate.
<LI><EM>measure length</EM>. This proves the termination of any function
    over lists that makes recursive calls on smaller lists.
<LI><EM>measure length o snd</EM>. This proves the termination of any function
    over pairs where the second element of the recursive argument is
    shorter than the second element of the original call.
</UL>

More complicated examples, like Ackermann's function, require
termination expressions involving lexicographic combinations, but the
reader can see these in the examples.

<HR>
<H2>TFL Entrypoints</H3>

In this section we discuss the entrypoints available in an instantiation
of <STRONG>TFL</STRONG>. Using these entrypoints, one can quickly build
easy-to-use facilities for defining recursive functions and reasoning
with recursion induction principles derived from such definitions.

<P>

The structures <STRONG>Rules</STRONG>, <STRONG>Thms</STRONG>,
<STRONG>Thry</STRONG>, and <STRONG>USyntax</STRONG> represent the basis
on which <STRONG>TFL</STRONG> is built. They provide such things as
common syntactic manipulations, specific theorems and inference rules,
and access to the underlying theory mechanism. The ordinary user should
have no great need to look at the implementations of these structures.

<P>

<STRONG>TFL</STRONG> also uses a collection of types:
<UL>
<LI><STRONG>Preterm</STRONG> is the type of lambda calculus
terms. These are thought to be untyped, although implementations may use
typed terms in their place, and make typechecking be a vacuous
operation. 
<LI><STRONG>Thry</STRONG> is the type of
theories. 
<LI><STRONG>Thm</STRONG> is the type of theorems.
<LI><STRONG>Tactic</STRONG> is the type of tactics.
</UL>

<HR>

<PRE>
   val mk_functional : Thry -> Preterm ->
                       {functional:Preterm, patterns:Preterm list}
</PRE>

<STRONG>mk_functional</STRONG> takes a theory and a conjunction of
recursion equations and returns the functional corresponding to the
equations and also the patterns used in the equations. The main
component in this operation is an ML-style pattern-matching
translation. For example, in HOL, with recursion equations
<PRE>
    (Fact 0 = 1) /\
    (Fact (Suc x) = Fact x * Suc x)
</PRE>

the output of <STRONG>mk_functional</STRONG> is

<PRE>
    {functional = `\Fact a. num_case 1 (\v. Fact v * Suc v) a`,
     patterns = [`0`,`Suc x`]}.
</PRE>
Note that the function being represented (<EM>Fact</EM> in this case)
should be a variable in the recursion equations. 
<HR>

<PRE>
   val prim_wfrec_definition : Thry 
                                -> {R:Preterm, functional:Preterm}
                                -> {def:Thm, corollary:Thm, theory:Thry}
</PRE>

<STRONG>prim_wfrec_definition</STRONG> is the main underlying definition
mechanism. It takes a relation <EM>R</EM> and a functional which looks
like <EM>\f x. N</EM>, the latter presumably derived from
<STRONG>mk_functional</STRONG>, and makes the definition  <EM>def</EM>
<PRE>     f = WFREC R (\f x. N).
</PRE>
It then instantiates and simplifies the wellfounded recursion theorem to
get <EM>corollary</EM>. For our example, we get, using <EM>(\m n. n =
Suc m) </EM> for <EM>R</EM>:
<PRE>
  {def= |- Fact =
            WFREC (\m n. n = Suc m) 
                  (\Fact a. num_case 1 (\v. Fact v * Suc v) a),
  corollary= |- WF (\m n. n = Suc m) ==>
                   !x. Fact x = (\Fact a. num_case 1 (\v. Fact v * Suc v) a)
                                (Fact % (\m n. n = Suc m),x)
                                x}.
</PRE>
<HR>
<PRE>
   val gen_wfrec_definition : Thry 
                               -> {R:Preterm, eqs:Preterm}
                               -> {theory:Thry, rules:Thm, 
                                   TCs:Preterm list list}
</PRE>
<STRONG>gen_wfrec_definition</STRONG> acts essentially as a pre- and
post-processor for <STRONG>prim_wfrec_definition</STRONG>. It takes
<EM>R</EM> as before, and takes <EM>eqs</EM>, a conjunction of recursion
equations. It then calls <STRONG>mk_functional</EM> to translate the
recursion equations to a functional, and then invokes
<STRONG>prim_wfrec_definition</STRONG> on the result to make the
definition. After that, there is a phase of <EM>termination condition
extraction</EM>: this traverses the definition and brings out formulae
that, when proven, allow the definition to be used freely. For example,
an invocation with <EM>R = (\m n. n = Suc m)</EM> and 
<EM>eqs = fact x = if (x = 0) then 1 else x * fact(x-1)</EM> gives the result
(momentarily ignoring the returned theory component):

<PRE>
    {rules = [WF (\m n. n = SUC m)]
             |- (!x. ~(x = 0) ==> (\m n. n = SUC m) (x - 1) x) ==>
                (fact x = ((x = 0) => 1 | (x * fact (x - 1)))),
     TCs = [[`!x. ~(x = 0) ==> (\m n. n = SUC m) (x - 1) x`]]}
</PRE>

Note well that even if these are not proven, the definition can still be
used. This is in contrast to some other approaches, where termination
must be proved before anything can be doen with the function.

<HR>
<PRE>
   val wfrec_eqns : Thry -> Preterm -> Preterm * Preterm 
                                       * (Thm * Preterm list) list

   val lazyR_def : Thry -> Preterm -> {theory: Thry, eqns:Thm, 
                                       TCs:Preterm list list}
</PRE>

<STRONG>wfrec_eqns</STRONG> is used to implement
<STRONG>lazyR_def</STRONG>, and is not of much interest.

<HR>
<PRE>
   val mk_induction : Thry -> Thm -> Preterm list list -> Thm
</PRE>
<HR>
<PRE>
   val postprocess: {WFtac:Tactic, terminator:Tactic, simplifier:Term -> Thm}
                    -> Thry 
                      -> {rules:Thm, induction:Thm, TCs:Preterm list list}
                          -> {rules:Thm, induction:Thm, TCs:Thm list}
</PRE>

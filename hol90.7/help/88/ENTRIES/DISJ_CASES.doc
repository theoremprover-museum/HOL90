\TYPE {DISJ_CASES : (thm -> thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates disjunction by cases.

\KEYWORDS
rule, disjunction, cases.

\DESCRIBE
The rule {DISJ_CASES} takes a disjunctive theorem, and two `case'
theorems, each with one of the disjuncts as a hypothesis while sharing
alpha-equivalent conclusions.  A new theorem is returned with the same
conclusion as the `case' theorems, and the union of all assumptions
excepting the disjuncts.
{
    A |- t1 \/ t2     A1 u {{t1}} |- t      A2 u {{t2}} |- t
   ------------------------------------------------------  DISJ_CASES
                    A u A1 u A2 |- t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a disjunctive theorem, or if the
conclusions of the other two theorems are not alpha-convertible.

\EXAMPLE
Specializing the built-in theorem {num_CASES} gives the theorem:
{
   th = |- (m = 0) \/ (?n. m = SUC n)
}
\noindent Using two additional theorems, each having one disjunct as a
hypothesis:
{
   th1 = (m = 0 |- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0))
   th2 = (?n. m = SUC n" |- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0))
}
\noindent a new theorem can be derived:
{
   #DISJ_CASES th th1 th2;;
   |- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0)
}
\COMMENTS
Neither of the `case' theorems is required to have either disjunct as a
hypothesis, but otherwise {DISJ_CASES} is pointless.

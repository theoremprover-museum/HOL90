@\DOC SPEC

\TYPE {SPEC : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {u} and a theorem {A |- !x. t}, then {SPEC} returns
the theorem {A |- t[u/x]}. If necessary, variables will be renamed prior
to the specialization to ensure that {u} is free for {x} in {t}, that is,
no variables free in {u} become bound after substitution.
{
     A |- !x. t
   --------------  SPEC "u"
    A |- t[u/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not universally quantified, or if {x} and
{u} have different types.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows how {SPEC} renames bound variables if necessary,
prior to substitution: a straightforward substitution would result in the
clearly invalid theorem {|- ~y ==> (!y. y ==> ~y)}.
{
   #let xv = "x:bool" and yv="y:bool" in
   #     (GEN xv o DISCH xv o GEN yv o DISCH yv) (ASSUME xv);;
   |- !x. x ==> (!y. y ==> x)

   #SPEC "~y" it;;
   |- ~y ==> (!y'. y' ==> ~y)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@Keeping you up to date:

I'm about to do a checkin of elsa's modifications to the hol90.7
sources to create her hol90.pre8.  To recap what I've done:
	- I checked out hol90 (in /usr/groups/hol/drs1004/hol90)
		cvs co hol90
	  (Well, to be honest, I only checked out those
	  parts of hol90 I knew I'd be changing, e.g. not the
	  Manual, and only parts of the library.  Checking out the
	  entire source takes a while, mainly due to the enormous number
	  of help files.  The limiting factor is files/second, which
         runs at around 5 when CVS is working on nfs over a network, not
         KB/second, which you might at first think it would be).

	- By doing a recursive diff between Elsa's source and the
	hol90.7 source I found all the changes Elsa had made to
	source files.  I copied relevant files from Elsa's source
	into my checked out version.  The only new files were
		- the sml_system files in src/0
		- some make scripts in src/.
	Changed files were in:
		src/{0,1,2,3}
		library/arith/src/thm_convs.sml
		library/list/src/list_conv1.sml
		library/num/src/num_lib.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/halts_logic.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/translation.sml
		library/prog_logic/theories/src/mk_halts.sml
		library/real/theories/src/Make
		library/real/theories/src/equiv.sml
		library/real/theories/src/seq.sml
		library/reduce/src/arithconv.sml
		library/string/src/string_conv.sml
		library/unity/theories/src/aux_definitions.sml
		library/word/theories/src/*

	- I will now commit these changes, with this email as the log message.
		cvs commit

	- Tomorrow I will get this version compiling
	with NJSML 108 (I will probably add
	the files to enable the NJSML compilation manager to make
	this easier), then check those changes in.  I think it's
	good to get things in a working state.

@The following are what I believe to be the externally visible changes I
have made to hol90.7 to  get hol90.8.  -  Elsa L. Gunter,  ATT Bell Labs.

0) Added a structure Sml_system, through which almost all of the system
dependancies have been factored.  This is basic to the way in which I
maintainned compatability with both sml-nj.93 and sml-nj.108.5 and greater.

1) Changed LESS to LESS_DEF in mk_prim_rec.sml

2) Changed GREATER to GREATER_DEF in mk_arithmetic.sml

3) Added

print_theory_to_outstream : {outstream:outstream, theory:string} -> outstream
print_theory_to_file : {file:string, theory:string} -> unit

to the structure Theory.  The first function returns an outstream because
we don't close it.  You might want to continue sending more things to it.
With the second we do close the stream, and so we return unit.

4) Changed the name of the structure Bool in hol90 has been changed to
Boolean, so that the structure Bool from sml will no longer be hidden.

@The core of hol90.9.alpha now builds successfully with SML/NJ 109,
SML/NJ 108.5 (using CM), SML/NJ 0.93, and Poly/ML 3.0.
I have not yet tried rebuilding the theory files.

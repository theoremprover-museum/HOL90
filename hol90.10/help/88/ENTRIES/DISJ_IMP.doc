\DOC DISJ_IMP

\TYPE {DISJ_IMP : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a disjunctive theorem to an equivalent implicative theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, disjunction, implication.

\DESCRIBE
The left disjunct of a disjunctive theorem becomes the negated
antecedent of the newly generated theorem.
{
     A |- t1 \/ t2
   -----------------  DISJ_IMP
    A |- ~t1 ==> t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not a disjunction.

\EXAMPLE
Specializing the built-in theorem {LESS_CASES} gives the theorem:
{
   th = |- m < n \/ n <= m
}
\noindent to which {DISJ_IMP} may be applied:
{
   #DISJ_IMP th;;
   |- ~m < n ==> n <= m
}

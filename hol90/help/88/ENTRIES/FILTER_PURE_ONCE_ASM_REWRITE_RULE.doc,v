@\DOC FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : ((term -> bool) -> thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem once using some of its assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
rule, selective.

\DESCRIBE
The first argument is a predicate applied to the assumptions. The theorem is
rewritten with the assumptions for which the predicate returns {true} and the
given list of theorems. It searches the term of the theorem once, without
applying rewrites recursively. Thus it avoids the divergence which can result
from the application of {FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE}. For more information
on rewriting rules, see {GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
This function is useful when rewriting with a subset of assumptions of
a theorem, allowing control of the number of rewriting passes.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

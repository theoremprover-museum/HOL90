\TYPE {print_theory : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints the contents of a HOL theory to the terminal.

\DESCRIBE
{print_theory `name`} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the
contents of the theory called {name}. {print_theory `-`} prints the current
theory. The following information is displayed: the parents of the theory,
types defined within the theory, type abbreviations defined within the theory,
constants of the theory, the binders and infixes (subsets of the constants),
the axioms, the definitions, and the derived theorems.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory does not exist or is not an ancestor of the current
theory.

\EXAMPLE
To obtain an example, type {print_theory `bool`;;} to the system.

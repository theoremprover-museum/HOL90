@\DOC EXISTS_ARITH_CONV

\TYPE {EXISTS_ARITH_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Partial decision procedure for non-universal Presburger natural arithmetic.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
{EXISTS_ARITH_CONV} is a partial decision procedure for formulae of Presburger
natural arithmetic which are in prenex normal form and have all variables
existentially quantified. Presburger natural arithmetic is the subset of
arithmetic formulae made up from natural number constants, numeric variables,
addition, multiplication by a constant, the relations {<}, {<=}, {=}, {>=}, {>}
and the logical connectives {~}, {/\}, {\/}, {==>}, {=} (if-and-only-if),
{!} (`forall') and {?} (`there exists'). Products of two expressions which
both contain variables are not included in the subset, but the function {SUC}
which is not normally included in a specification of Presburger arithmetic is
allowed in this HOL implementation.

Given a formula in the specified subset, the function attempts to prove that
it is equal to {T} (true). The procedure is incomplete; it is not able to
prove all formulae in the subset.

\FAILURE
The function can fail in two ways. It fails if the argument term is not a
formula in the specified subset, and it also fails if it is unable to prove
the formula. The failure strings are different in each case.

\EXAMPLE
{
#EXISTS_ARITH_CONV "?m n. m < n";;
|- (?m n. m < n) = T

#EXISTS_ARITH_CONV "?m n. (2 * m) + (3 * n) = 10";;
|- (?m n. (2 * m) + (3 * n) = 10) = T
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC PEXISTS_RULE

\TYPE {PEXISTS_RULE : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces a paired existential quantification in place of a paired choice.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {PEXISTS_RULE} expects a theorem asserting that
{(@@p. t)} denotes a pair for which {t} holds.
The equivalent assertion that there exists a {p} for which {t} holds is
returned.
{
    A |- t[(@@p. t)/p]
   ------------------  PEXISTS_RULE
       A |- ?p. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
of the form {(t[(@@p.t)/p])}.

\SEEALSO
PEXISTS_CONV, PSELECT_RULE, PSELECT_CONV, PSELECT_INTRO, PSELECT_ELIM.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

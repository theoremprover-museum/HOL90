@\DOC PEXISTENCE

\TYPE {PEXISTENCE : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, unique, existential.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Deduces paired existence from paired unique existence.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem with a paired unique-existentially quantified
conclusion, {EXISTENCE} returns the same theorem with normal paired 
existential quantification over the same pair.
{
    A |- ?!p. t
   -------------  PEXISTENCE
    A |- ?p. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the conclusion of the theorem is a paired unique-existential
quantification.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

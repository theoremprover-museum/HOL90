@\DOC print_state

\TYPE {print_state : (int -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints the top levels of  the subgoal package goal stack.

\DESCRIBE
The function {print_state} is part of the subgoal package. Calling
{print_state n} prints the top {n} levels of the goal stack of the current
proof state (that is, the top {n} levels of unproven subgoals). If more than
one subgoal is produced, they are printed from the bottom of the stack so that
the current goal is printed last. If {n} is negative or is greater than the
number of levels on the goal stack, the whole stack is printed. If no goal has
been set or {n} is zero, nothing will be printed. If the original goal has just
been proved so that the proof state consists of a theorem, and {n} is non-zero,
{goal proved} is printed. For a description of the subgoal package, see
{set_goal}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#g "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])";;
"(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

() : void

#e CONJ_TAC;;
OK..
2 subgoals
"TL[1;2;3] = [2;3]"

"HD[1;2;3] = 1"

() : void

#print_state 2;;
"(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

2 subgoals
"TL[1;2;3] = [2;3]"

"HD[1;2;3] = 1"

() : void
}
\USES
Examining the proof state during an interactive proof session.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

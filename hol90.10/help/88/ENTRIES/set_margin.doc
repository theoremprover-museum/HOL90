\DOC set_margin

\TYPE {set_margin : (int -> int)}

\SYNOPSIS
Changes the limit on the width of the output produced by the pretty-printer.

\DESCRIBE
{set_margin i} sets the limit on the width of the output produced by the
pretty-printer to the integer {i}. The pretty-printer will try to avoid
exceeding this limit by breaking the text into multiple lines. However it can
only break at points specified by the functions that send text to it. The
result of a call to {set_margin} is the value to which the margin was
previously set.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
Obtaining readable output when using a text window of non-standard width.
It is a good idea to set the margin to a few characters less than the actual
width of the window; for example the default is 72 for an 80 character wide
display.

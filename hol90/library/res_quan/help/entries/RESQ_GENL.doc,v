@\DOC RESQ_GENL

\TYPE {RESQ_GENL : ((term # term) list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes zero or more variables to restricted universal quantification
in the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-pair list {[(x1,P1);...;(xn,Pn)]} and a theorem 
{A |- t}, the inference rule {RESQ_GENL} returns the theorem 
{A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t}, provided none of the
variables {xi} are free in any of the assumptions except in the corresponding
{Pi}. It is not necessary that any or all of the {xi} should be free in {t}.
{
         A |- t
   ------------------------------  RESQ_GENL "[(x1,P1);...;(xn,Pn)]" 
    A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t   [where no xi is free in A except in Pi]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless all the terms {xi} in the list are variables, none of which are
free in the assumption list except in {Pi}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

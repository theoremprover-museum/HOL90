\SYNOPSIS

\KEYWORDS
file.

\DESCRIBE
Given a string argument {`foo`}, {openw} creates a new file {foo}
(overwriting an existing file with the same name) and returns a string
(a port identifier) that can be used by {write} to write characters to the
 file. The port identifier is also used by {close} to close the file.

\EXAMPLE
{
#let port = openw `foo`;;
port = `%foo` : string

#write (port, `contents of file foo\L`);;
() : void

#close port;;
() : void

#system `cat foo`;;
contents of file foo
0 : int
}

\TYPE {AND_PEXISTS_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired existential quantification outwards through a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(?p. t) /\ (?p. u)}, where no
variables in {p} are free in either {t} or {u}, {AND_PEXISTS_CONV} returns
the theorem:
{
   |- (?p. t) /\ (?p. u) = (?p. t /\ u)
}
\FAILURE
{AND_PEXISTS_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{(?p. t) /\ (?p. u)}, or if it is applied to a term {(?p. t) /\ (?p. u)}
in which variables from {p} are free in either {t} or {u}.

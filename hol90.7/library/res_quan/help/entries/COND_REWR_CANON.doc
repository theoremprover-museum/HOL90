\TYPE {COND_REWR_CANON : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Transform a theorem into a form accepted by {COND_REWR_TAC}.

\KEYWORDS
derived rule, rewriting, conditional.

\DESCRIBE
{COND_REWR_CANON} transforms a theorem into a form accepted by {COND_REWR_TAC}.
The input theorem should be an implication of the following form
{
   !x1 ... xn. P1[xi] ==> ... ==> !y1 ... ym. Pr[xi,yi] ==>
     (!z1 ... zk. u[xi,yi,zi] = v[xi,yi,zi])
}
\noindent where each antecedent {Pi} itself may be a conjunction or
disjunction. The output theorem will have all universal quantifications
moved to the outer most level with possible renaming to prevent
variable capture, and have all antecedents which are a conjunction
transformed to implications. The output theorem will be in the
following form
{
   !x1 ... xn y1 ... ym z1 ... zk. 
    P11[xi] ==> ... ==> P1p[xi] ==> ... ==>
     Pr1[xi,yi] ==> ... ==> Prq[x1,yi] ==> (u[xi,yi,zi] = v[xi,yi,zi])
}

\FAILURE
This function fails if the input theorem is not in the correct form.

\EXAMPLE
{COND_REWR_CANON} transforms the built-in theorem {CANCL_SUB} into the
form for conditional rewriting:
{
   #COND_REWR_CANON CANCEL_SUB;;
   Theorem CANCEL_SUB autoloading from theory `arithmetic` ...
   CANCEL_SUB = |- !p n m. p <= n /\ p <= m ==> ((n - p = m - p) = (n = m))

   |- !p n m. p <= n ==> p <= m ==> ((n - p = m - p) = (n = m))
}

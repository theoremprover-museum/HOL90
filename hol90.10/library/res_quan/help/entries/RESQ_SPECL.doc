\DOC RESQ_SPECL

\TYPE {RESQ_SPECL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes zero or more variables in the conclusion of a restricted
universally quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term list {[u1;...;un]} and a theorem
{A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t}, the inference rule {RESQ_SPECL} returns
the theorem
{
   A,P1 u1,...,Pn un |- t[u1/x1]...[un/xn]
}
\noindent where the substitutions are made
sequentially left-to-right in the same way as for {RESQ_SPEC}, with the same
sort of alpha-conversions applied to {t} if necessary to ensure that no
variables which are free in {ui} become bound after substitution.
{
           A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t
   --------------------------------------------  RESQ_SPECL "[u1;...;un]"
     A,P1 u1, ..., Pn un |- t[u1/x1]...[un/xn]
}
\noindent It is permissible for the term-list to be empty, in which case
the application of {RESQ_SPECL} has no effect.

\FAILURE
Fails if one of the specialization of the 
restricted universally quantified variable in the original theorem fails.

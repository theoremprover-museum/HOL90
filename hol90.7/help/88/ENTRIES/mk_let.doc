\DOC mk_let

\TYPE {mk_let : ((term # term) -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs a {let} term.

\DESCRIBE
{mk_let("f","x")} returns {"LET f x"}. If {f} is of the form {"\y. t"} then
the result will be pretty-printed as {"let y=x in t"}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {mk_let} if the types of {f} and {x} are such that {"LET f x"} is
not well-typed. {"LET"} has most general type:
{
   ":(* -> **) -> * -> **"
}
\EXAMPLE
{
#mk_let("$= 1","2");;
"LET($= 1)2" : term

#mk_let("\x. x = 1","2");;
"let x = 2 in (x = 1)" : term
}
\SEEALSO
dest_let, is_let.

@\DOC EVERY_TCL

\TYPE {EVERY_TCL : (thm_tactical list -> thm_tactical)}

\SYNOPSIS
Composes a list of theorem-tacticals.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When given a list of theorem-tacticals and a theorem, {EVERY_TCL} simply
composes their effects on the theorem. The effect is:
{
   EVERY_TCL [ttl1;...;ttln] = ttl1 THEN_TCL ... THEN_TCL ttln
}
\noindent In other words, if:
{
   ttl1 ttac th1 = ttac th2  ...  ttln ttac thn = ttac thn'
}
\noindent then:
{
   EVERY_TCL [ttl1;...;ttln] ttac th1 = ttac thn'
}
\noindent If the theorem-tactical list is empty, the resulting theorem-tactical
behaves in the same way as {ALL_THEN}, the identity theorem-tactical.

\FAILURE
The application to a list of theorem-tacticals never fails.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

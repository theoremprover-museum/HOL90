\TYPE {g : (term -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Initializes the subgoal package with a new goal which has no assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   g "tm"
}
\noindent is equivalent to
{
   set_goal([],"tm")
}
\noindent and clearly more convenient if a goal has no assumptions.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the argument term has type {bool}.

\EXAMPLE
{
g "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])";;
"(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

() : void
}

This directory contains a collection of case studies using the HOL
inductive definitions package.  The contents are:

    opsem.ml    : operational semantics of a simple imperative language
    cl.ml       : Church-Rosser theorem for combinatory logic 
    mil.ml      : minimal intuitionistic logic and Curry-Howard isomorphism
    algebra.ml  : semantics of a simple process algebra

    compat.ml	: compatability file for HOL version 2.0
    ind-defs.ml : inductive definitions package for version 2.01 

The examples are designed to run in version 2.01, but the above compatability
files are provided to allow them to be run also in version 2.0.

There is an accompanying technical report:

    J. Camilleri and T. Melham,
    Reasoning with Inductively Defined Relations
    in the HOL Theorem Prover, Technical Report 
    No. 265, University of Cambridge Computer
    Laboratory (August 1992).

the abstract for which is

    Inductively defined relations are among the basic
    mathematical tools of computer science. Examples
    include evaluation and computation relations in
    structural operational semantics, labelled transition
    relations in process algebra semantics,
    inductively-defined typing judgements, and proof
    systems in general.  This paper describes a set of HOL
    theorem-proving tools for reasoning about such
    inductively defined relations.  We also describe a
    suite of worked examples using these tools.

The report is available by sending email to tfm@cl.cam.ac.uk.

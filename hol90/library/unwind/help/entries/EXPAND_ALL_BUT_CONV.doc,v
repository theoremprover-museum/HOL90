@\DOC EXPAND_ALL_BUT_CONV

\TYPE {EXPAND_ALL_BUT_CONV : (string list -> thm list -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Unfolds, then unwinds all lines (except those specified) as much as possible,
then prunes the unwound lines.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{EXPAND_ALL_BUT_CONV [`li(k+1)`;...;`lim`] thl} when applied to the following
term:
{
   "?l1 ... lm. t1 /\ ... /\ ui1 /\ ... /\ uik /\ ... /\ tn"
}
\noindent returns a theorem of the form:
{
   B |- (?l1 ... lm. t1 /\ ... /\ ui1 /\ ... /\ uik /\ ... /\ tn) =
        (?li(k+1) ... lim. t1' /\ ... /\ tn')
}
\noindent where each {ti'} is the result of rewriting {ti} with the theorems in
{thl}. The set of assumptions {B} is the union of the instantiated assumptions
of the theorems used for rewriting. If none of the rewrites are applicable to a
conjunct, it is unchanged. Those conjuncts that after rewriting are equations
for the lines {li1,...,lik} (they are denoted by {ui1,...,uik}) are used to
unwind and the lines {li1,...,lik} are then pruned.

The {li}'s are related by the equation:
{
   {{li1,...,lik}} u {{li(k+1),...,lim}} = {{l1,...,lm}}
}

\FAILURE
The function may fail if the argument term is not of the specified form. It
will also fail if the unwound lines cannot be pruned. It is possible for the
function to attempt unwinding indefinitely (to loop).

\EXAMPLE
{
#EXPAND_ALL_BUT_CONV [`l1`]
# [ASSUME "!in out. INV (in,out) = !(t:num). out t = ~(in t)"]
# "?l1 l2.
#   INV (l1,l2) /\ INV (l2,out) /\ (!(t:num). l1 t = l2 (t-1) \/ out (t-1))";;
. |- (?l1 l2.
       INV(l1,l2) /\ INV(l2,out) /\ (!t. l1 t = l2(t - 1) \/ out(t - 1))) =
     (?l1.
       (!t. out t = ~~l1 t) /\ (!t. l1 t = ~l1(t - 1) \/ ~~l1(t - 1)))
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

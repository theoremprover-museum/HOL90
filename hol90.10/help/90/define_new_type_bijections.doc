\TYPE {define_new_type_bijections 
               :{{name :string, ABS :string, REP :string, tyax :thm}} -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces abstraction and representation functions for a defined type.

\DESCRIBE
The result of making a type definition using {new_type_definition} is a
theorem of the following form:
{
   |- ?rep:nty->ty. TYPE_DEFINITION P rep
}
\noindent which asserts only the existence of a bijection from the type it
defines (in this case, {nty}) to the corresponding subset of an existing type
(here, {ty}) whose characteristic function is specified by {P}.  To
automatically introduce constants that in fact denote this bijection and its
inverse, the ML function {define_new_type_bijections} is provided.

{name} is the name under which the constant definition (a constant
specification, in fact) made by {define_new_type_bijections} will be
stored in the current theory segment. {tyax} must be a definitional
axiom of the form returned by {new_type_definition}. {ABS} and {REP} are
the user-specified names for the two constants that are to be defined.
These constants are defined so as to denote mutually inverse bijections
between the defined type, whose definition is given by {tyax}, and the
representing type of this defined type.


If {th} is a theorem of the form returned by {new_type_definition}:
{
   |- ?rep:newty->ty. TYPE_DEFINITION P rep
}
\noindent then evaluating:
{
   define_new_type_bijections{{name="name",ABS="abs",REP="rep",tyax=th}} th
}
\noindent automatically defines two new constants {abs:ty->newty} and
{rep:newty->ty} such that:
{
   |- (!a. abs(rep a) = a) /\ (!r. P r = (rep(abs r) = r))
}
\noindent This theorem, which is the defining property for the constants {abs}
and {rep}, is stored under the name {name} in the current theory segment.  It
is also the value returned by {define_new_type_bijections}.  The theorem states
that {abs} is the left inverse of {rep} and, for values satisfying {P}, that
{rep} is the left inverse of {abs}.


\FAILURE
A call to {define_new_type_bijections{{name=s1,ABS=s2,REP=s3,tyax=th}}} fails 
if {th} is not a theorem of the form returned by {new_type_definition}, or 
if either {s2} or {s3} is already the name of a constant in the current 
theory, or there already exists a constant definition, constant specification,
type definition or axiom named {s1} in the current theory, or HOL is not in 
draft mode.

\DOC type_lt

\TYPE {type_lt : hol_type -> hol_type -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
A total ordering function on types.

\DESCRIBE
{type_lt} tells whether one type is less than another in the ordering.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
    - type_lt (==`:bool`==) (==`:'a -> 'a`==)
    val it = true : bool
}

\COMMENTS
If {not (type_lt ty1 ty2)} and {not (type_lt ty2 ty1)}, then {ty1 = ty2}, 
although it is faster to directly test for equality. Ordering of types may 
be useful in implementing search trees and the like.

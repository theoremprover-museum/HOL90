The <STRONG>hol90</STRONG> system is a re-implementation in SML/NJ of
the Cambridge HOL system (<STRONG>hol88</STRONG>). The proof support of
hol90 (term manipulation, axioms, inference rules, tactics, conversions,
theories, libraries, <EM>etc.</EM>) is intended to be a replacement for
that of hol88.  The major difference between the two systems is that
they have been implemented in two different dialects of ML; a host of
minor differences are discussed throughout this document. 
<P>

<STRONG>Note.</STRONG>It would be surprising if you could learn HOL only
through this user manual. The Gordon and Melham book
(<STRONG>Introduction to HOL</STRONG>, Cambridge University Press, 1993)
provides a good place to start. Alternatively, you might consider a
hol90 training course: contact

<H1><A NAME = "FAQ">Common questions and problems</A></H1>

The following are some common questions and problems that might arise
when one is dealing with hol90.

<DL>
  
<DT><STRONG>Why all these type annotations?</STRONG>

<DD>People new to HOL systems often ask why they have to add type
annotations to their terms. This was a design decision made by Robin
Milner for the original LCF system, and we have not found reason to
change. hol90 performs full Hindley-Milner type inference, inferring
most general types, and then fails if any type variable is still
unconstrained. If this wasn't done, inference rules would have to
normalize types at runtime. For example, in
<PRE>
    ABS `x` (REFL `x`)
</PRE>
<KBD>ABS</KBD> would in general need to unify the types of the two
<KBD>x</KBD>s, in order to make the types in the argument term and the
occurrences in the theorem agree. In any case, those who want to
experiment with type inference can write their own typechecker and use
it in parsing, since the kernel of the system is independent of the
particular type checker used.

<DT><STRONG>My library take ages to load!</STRONG>
<DD>
A current shortcoming of hol90 libraries is that any code loaded will be
source, not object, so loading will be slower. As soon as SML/NJ's
separate compilation facility settles down, this will be fixed. In the mean
time, there is a function <STRONG>prim_load_theory</STRONG> of type
<PRE>
    (string -> unit) -> {lib:lib, theory:string} -> unit
</PRE>
The first argument is a <EM>code_loader</EM> function - it is invoked on each
file in the <KBD>code</KBD> section of a library. Two possible ways to use
this are to: compile the code of a library or to intepret the code. The 
first option is already present in the functionality of the derived form 
<KBD>load_library</KBD>, <EM>i.e.</EM>,
<PRE>
    val load_library = prim_load_library Lib.compile;
</PRE>
Another specialization of <KBD>prim_load_library</KBD> would load 
the code quickly, but execution of that code would be slow. It would 
be appropriate for small memory machines and it would be defined:
<PRE>
    val fast_load_library = prim_load_library Lib.interpret
</PRE>
This has not, however, been installed in the system. Another solution
would be for users to load commonly used libraries and then
dump the image with <KBD>save_hol</KBD>.

<DT><STRONG>My theory (or library) doesn't load and fails with a strange error 
            message!</STRONG>
<DD>In an improperly installed hol90 system, the following behaviour 
can sometimes occur:
<PRE>
    - load_library {lib=set_lib, theory="foo"} handle e => Raise e;

    Loading the library "set".
      ... < many loading messages >
    Exception raised at Library.add_new_parent:
    Theory.new_parent.install_new_parent.get_file_by_key: 
       unable to get the file "HOL.holsig"
</PRE>

Here the problem is probably that the theory <KBD>set</KBD> found in the
<EM>set</EM> library is out-of-date with respect to the <KBD>HOL</KBD>
theory. The source of the problem is that hol90 uses unique ids (name +
timestamp) to implement theories securely.  When <KBD>load_library</KBD>
is asked to load <EM>set_lib</EM>, it declares the theory <KBD>foo</KBD>
and attempts to do a <KBD>new_parent</KBD> on the theory
<KBD>set</KBD>. The theory <KBD>set</KBD> is found on disk. Its parents
(name + timestamp) are used to chain back in the theory graph until the
frontier of the existing theory graph is found.

<P>

When looking for the parents of a theory, first they are looked for in
the internally held graph representing the loaded HOL theories. The
equality test involves both the theory names and the timestamps. If not
found, then the search goes to disk, using
<KBD>Globals.theory_path</KBD> as denoting the places to look.  When the
parents of <KBD>set</KBD>, i.e., the <KBD>HOL</KBD> theory, is not
found, that means the particular <KBD>HOL</KBD> theory being searched
for does not exist in the internal graph structure. Since we know that
<EM>a</EM> <KBD>HOL</KBD> theory is certainly there, the theory
<KBD>set</KBD> and hence the library <KBD>set</KBD> is out-of-date with
respect to the core HOL system.  The typical reason for this is that the
core HOL system has been made by invoking

<PRE>
    make_hol <sml> -n
</PRE>

but that the libraries were not subsequently remade. By the way, a
simple test of whether the theory <KBD>set</KBD> is up-to-date, is to
attempt to do a

<PRE>
    load_theory "set" handle e => Raise e;
</PRE>


<DT><STRONG>Why have both</STRONG> <KBD>Psyntax</KBD> <STRONG>and</STRONG> <KBD>Rsyntax</KBD>?

<DD> That is, why have two copies of the same thing? There are good
arguments for and against both styles, so the hol90 implementors decided
to make both syntaxes available. The argument for records? Record types
often give better information about what the arguments of a function
are. Compare
<PRE>
   Psyntax.new_specification 
       :string->(string*string*int) list -> thm -> thm
</PRE>
with
<PRE>
   Rsyntax.new_specification : 
       {name :string,  sat_thm : Thm.thm,
        consts:{const_name:string, fixity:Term.fixity} list} -> Thm.thm
</PRE>
Furthermore, code written with records can be more readable when
intensive term manipulations are being performed. Alternatively, it can
be much clumsier to write such code, since the syntax of records entails
more verbosity.

<DT> <STRONG>Autoloading failure.</STRONG>

<DD>Some derived principles of definition may define symbolic constants, 
    and need to generate a name to store the definition with on a theory 
    file. Usually this name generation is done by prepending the name of
    the constant being defined to "_DEF". This can give us strange names,
    like 
    <PRE>
       ;;_DEF
    </PRE>
    which is half symbolic identifier and half ordinary identifier. This 
    strangeness is not a problem when loading the theory, but such theory
    bindings will not be autoloadable; the system will issue a warning 
    message when autoloading such a binding and skip over it.

<DT> <STRONG>Problems in parsing symbolic identifiers.</STRONG>

<DD>The inclusion of ":" in the "symbolics" means that some constraints may
    need to be separated by white space. For example
    <PRE>
        $=:bool->bool->bool
    </PRE>
    will be broken up by the lexer as
    <PRE>
        $=: bool -> bool -> bool
    </PRE>
    and parsed as an application of the symbolic identifier "$=:" to
    the term argument list ["bool", "->", "bool", "->", "bool"]. But
    <PRE>
        $= :bool->bool->bool
    </PRE>
    is OK, being parsed as the symbolic identifier "=" constrained by a type.
    Another example involves the comma, which is also a symbolic identifier:
    <PRE>
       ($+,T)
    </PRE>
    the intended pairing of the addition function with the constant "T" will 
    fail to typecheck because the phrase will be broken up as 
    <PRE>
        (  $+,  T  )
    </PRE>
    and interpreted as a variable "+," applied to "T". The intended parse is 
    achieved by inserting a space before the comma.

<DT> <STRONG>Non-confluence in rewriting</STRONG>

<DD> In both hol88 and hol90, the rewriting process will occasionally
    encounter a term to which more than one rewrite will be applicable. 
    The first match will be the one used to rewrite the term. It can happen
    (rarely) that hol90 will choose a different first match than hol88, and
    that the result will be different. This is an example of non-confluence.
    Some proofs from hol88 may break as a result.

<DT> <STRONG>Renaming</STRONG>

<DD>The basic hol90 term operations "subst" and "inst" do the least 
    possible variable renaming within the bounds given by certain strictures 
    (such as being able to re-parse prettyprinted terms to themselves). 
    hol88 will sometimes rename unnecessarily, and this can, at times, cause 
    a proof not to port. This typically occurs in the case of supplying 
    witnesses to EXISTS_TAC. A sure tip off is a proof that won't port 
    because there is a primed existential witness in the tactic, e.g.,
    <PRE>
        EXISTS_TAC "x'"
    </PRE>
    Often, removing the prime will enable the proof to go through.

For those hol88 users migrating to hol90, SML has a Core language subset
that is quite close to ML Classic. A comparative reading of the hol88
and hol90 sources will go a long way towards making one "Core
SML-fluent". One might start by reading the 

<A HREF ="../src/0/lib.sml">hol90 "standard prelude"</A>, 

which provides many utility functions used in building the system. 
<P>

The formal semantics of SML is found in <STRONG>The Definition of
Standard ML</STRONG> (MIT Press 1990) and some discussion of the
semantics can be found in <STRONG>Commentary on Standard ML</STRONG>
(MIT Press 1990). These books are for reference, and are by no means
introductory texts. A gentler introduction is Larry Paulson's textbook,
<STRONG>ML for the Working Programmer</STRONG> (Cambridge University
Press, 1991).

As stated in the introduction to this manual, there are few differences
between hol88 and hol90, at least at the level of theorem
proving. However, there is a host of differences in the support for
theorem proving and so a straghtforward compatibility package is not
possible. We have, however, made a minor effort at supporting those who
are used to hol88: in conjunction with the built-in structure
<KBD>Psyntax</KBD>, <KBD>hol88_lib</KBD> gives hol90 some ability to
mimic hol88. Therefore, to operate as much as possible in a hol88-like
environment, one would do the following:

<PRE>
    load_library{lib = hol88_lib, theory = "-"};
    open Psyntax Compat;
</PRE>

<P>
<STRONG>Warning</STRONG>: <KBD>hol88_lib</KBD> is by no means complete!
If you have additions you want made, please send them to the author of
this document.

The following hol88 facilities do not appear in hol90.

<UL>
<LI> Interface maps and constant hiding. 
<LI> Type abbreviations (for the logic).
</UL>

As well, there are still a few libraries have not yet been
ported. Finally, the <KBD>contrib</KBD> directory is much smaller than
that of hol88.


<H2>Conversion between the two systems</H2>

Currently, there are no good tools for converting between the two
systems. A set of gnuemacs functions for doing elementary conversions
between Classic ML and SML files is provided with the release, in the
"tools" directory. They work best on files that are mainly proofs; files
of general ML code really need a more comprehensive solution. In spite
of that, any gmacs hackers who want to expand the capabilities of these
functions are warmly encouraged!

Here we give a listing of all types defined by hol90 on top of SML. The
definitions of type abbreviations are given. Most of the other types are
abstract, and have specially installed prettyprinters so that users can
"see" values of these opaque types.

<H2><A NAME = "Exceptions">Exceptions</A></H2>

The multitude of exceptions that hol90 can raise have been shepherded
into one:
<PRE>
    exception HOL_ERR of {origin_structure : string,
                          origin_function : string,
                          message :string}
</PRE>

The three fields are, in order: the name of the structure that the
raising routine inhabits; the name of the raising routine; and the
message. Any exception that propagates to the top level should either be
HOL_ERR or defined in the SML/NJ pervasive environment.
<P>
Unfortunately, SML/NJ does not automatically print the values of
exceptions that propagate to the top level. To help in this, the
structure Exception (where HOL_ERR is defined) provides the routines
<PRE>
    print_HOL_ERR: exn -> unit
    Raise : exn -> 'a
</PRE>
The first prints out HOL_ERR in a fashion prescribed by the (assignable)
function Globals.output_HOL_ERR. The second does the same (provided
Globals.print_exceptions is set to true), but also raises the exception
again. This feature is handy for debugging and also for reporting
HOL_ERR, since it saves on finding a value of the proper type to return:
<PRE>
    el 3 ["foo","bar"] handle e => (print_HOL_ERR e; "blag");
    el 3 ["foo","bar"] handle e => Raise e;
</PRE>
<P>
<A HREF = "#Table of Contents">Table of Contents</A>
<HR>

<H2><A NAME = "Help">Help</A></H2>

A primitive on-line help system exists: an invocation of "help" on the 
subject of interest, e.g.,
<P>
<PRE>
    help "X"
</PRE>

follows the help_path until it finds a file X.doc. Then it makes a
system call to process the file and print the results to std_out. An
assignable string interpreted as an operating system function is used
for printing: it is the variable
<P>
<PRE>
       Globals.output_help : string ref
</PRE>
<P>
which is initially set to "/bin/cat". If you find that "help" fails
because the system call fails, you should try the auxiliary help
function "help1", which produces TeX-annotated, but still readable,
output.
<P>

Unhappily, hol90 is not as yet self-sufficient in the area of help
files: it relies primarily on the hol88 documentation. This is not that
bad, since most of the functionality in the two systems is identical,
particularly in the area of proof functions. However, at times the help is
deficient or downright unhelpful!
<P>

It can happen that you will able to get help for a function that doesn't
exist in the system, e.g., "dest_pred". To ease your puzzlement, there is
"meta-help" for this: do
<PRE>
    help "hol88_extras";
</PRE>
which will return a complete listing of all entry points of hol88 that
aren't also in hol90. Each entry has a one-line explanation; often the
entry point, if it is useful, has a different name in hol90. Many
entries in the list are not useful and should in fact be deleted from
hol88.
<P>

<H2><A NAME = "Paths">Paths</A></H2>

The following paths exist in the structure Globals:
<PRE>
    theory_path : string list ref
    library_path : string list ref
    help_path : string list ref
</PRE>
These are used to find theories, libraries, and help. The three paths
are independent. Each path begins with an empty path (""), so that help,
theories and libraries can be designated by absolute pathnames. The
paths are used primarily to find files to read, load, or print; however,
the theory and library paths are also used to determine where to write a
theory or library, respectively. In this case, the first member of the
list is taken as the prefix of the pathname of the file to be written.
If the write fails, no further attempts are made using other members of
the list.
<P>
There are some functions for manipulating paths:
<PRE>
    Lib.cons_path : string -> string list ref -> unit
    Lib.append_path : string -> string list ref -> unit
</PRE>
In "cons_path", an attempt is made to keep the empty path first in the
path list. This is helpful for developing local versions of system
theories, help, and libraries.

All assignable variables in the system are held in the structure

<H2><A NAME = "hol-init files">HOL start-up files</A></H2>


When hol90 is invoked, it looks for a file called "hol-init.sml", first
in the current directory, then in the user's home directory. A "use" is
performed on the first hol-init.sml found. This support is extended to
all binaries resulting from an invocation of "save_hol". This service
can be disabled by assigning Globals.use_init_file to false.

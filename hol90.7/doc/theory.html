In the HOL world a <EM>theory</EM> is used as a means of encapsulating
logical entities. Typically, a theory is a related collection of types,
constants, axioms, definitions, and theorems. Here we describe, in some
detail, although not precisely, the hol90 theory facilities.

When you use HOL, you are always <EM>in</EM> a theory, which is called
the <EM>current theory</EM>. (Most theory-related functions will treat
the "dash" ("-") as a synonym for the name of the current theory.) When
HOL starts up, the current theory you are in is named
<KBD>HOL</KBD>. This theory represents the culmination of a fair bit of
logical development, and as a result the <KBD>HOL</KBD> theory has many
<EM>ancestors</EM>.

<H2><A NAME = "Ancestry">Ancestry</A></H2>

Every theory except for the initial theory (named <KBD>min</KBD> in
hol90) has one or more parent theories (found by calling
<KBD>parents</KBD>). If you follow the parentage all the way back to
<KBD>min</KBD>, accumulating all the theories you go through, you will have
computed the <EM>ancestry</EM> of the theory (there is a function called
<KBD>ancestry</KBD> that will do this for you). All the types,
constants, axioms, definitions, and theorems of the ancestors of a
theory are accessible in the theory.(Note: what we are calling
"theories" here are called "theory segments" in the HOL manual/book.)

<P>
The entire collection of theories is held in a hierarchical graph
structure (a directed acyclic graph with a single root node). Some
elements of this structure are held on disk; others are in the ML heap.
The HOL system tries to make the location of a theory transparent to the
user.
<P>

<STRONG>Note</STRONG>.
The function <KBD>ancestry</KBD>, like many theory-related functions, can only
be given the name of a theory that is either the current theory, or an
ancestor of the current theory.

<H2><A NAME = "Building a theory">Building a theory</A></H2>

One makes a theory by a call to <KBD>new_theory</KBD>.  A theory built
with <KBD>new_theory</KBD> has as parent the current theory at the time
of the call to <KBD>new_theory</KBD>. Once you have called
<KBD>new_theory</KBD>, you are in <EM>draft mode</EM> (a call to
<KBD>draft_mode</KBD> will verify this): now you can freely make definitions
for types and constants.

<PRE>
    (* Operations that change the current theory *)
    val new_theory : string -> unit
    val close_theory : unit -> unit

    (* Adding to the current theory *)
    val new_parent : string -> unit
    val new_type : {Name : string, Arity : int} -> unit
    val new_constant :{Name : string, Ty : hol_type} -> unit
    val new_infix : {Name : string, Ty : hol_type, Prec :int} -> unit
    val new_binder : {Name : string, Ty : hol_type} -> unit

    (* Introduce an axiom *)
    val new_open_axiom : (string * term) -> Thm.thm

    (* Constant specification *)
    val new_specification 
        : {name :string, sat_thm : thm,
           consts : {fixity :fixity,const_name : string} list}
          -> thm

    (* Definitions *)
    val new_definition : (string * term) -> thm
    val new_infix_definition :(string * term * int) -> thm
    val new_binder_definition : (string *  term) -> thm
    val new_type_definition 
        : {name:string, pred:term, inhab_thm : thm} -> thm

    val save_thm : (string * thm) -> thm
</PRE>

Also, while in draft mode you can freely make any theory a parent theory
with a call to <KBD>new_parent</KBD>. If theory <VAR>X</VAR> is made a
new parent, the entire ancestry of <VAR>X</VAR> becomes accessible. Seen
from a graph level, <KBD>new_parent</KBD> adds an edge to the theory
graph, while <KBD>new_theory</KBD> adds a new node and a new edge to the
graph.  (Note: a theory in draft mode has <EM>no</EM> descendants. This
prevents cycles in the graph.) Draft mode is exited by calling
<KBD>close_theory</KBD>. One can prove and store theorems in the current
theory regardless of the draft mode.

<P>
When <KBD>new_theory</KBD> is called, the contents of the current theory are
written to disk before the new theory is constructed. That is, unless 
the theory is already consistent with disk (this is kept track of 
internally).

<H2><A NAME = "Going to an existing theory">
               Going to an existing theory</A></H3>

One "goes to" a theory with a call to <KBD>load_theory</KBD> (or in rare cases,
<KBD>extend_theory</KBD>). 
<PRE>
    val load_theory : string -> unit
    val extend_theory : string -> unit
</PRE>

Because of the ancestry relation, there are some subtle issues with
these operations.  With a call to <KBD>load_theory</KBD> or
<KBD>extend_theory</KBD>, you can go to any theory <EM>provided</EM>
that it is a descendant of the current theory. As with
<KBD>new_parent</KBD>, the entire ancestry of the "gone-to" theory will
then become accessible.  The semantics of <KBD>load_theory</KBD> is
somewhat confusing, but it is necessary in order to maintain consistency
of the system. Once you have loaded a theory, you may prove theorems and
store them in the theory, but you may not add new definitions (if you
want to do that, use <KBD>extend_theory</KBD> instead of
<KBD>load_theory</KBD>). You can not load or extend an ancestor of the
current theory.

<P>
<STRONG>Note</STRONG>. Once <KBD>new_theory</KBD> has been called
implicitly or explicitly in a session, <KBD>load_theory</KBD> is not
invocable. Why? Because a) a theory in draft mode has no descendants,
and b) nothing that can happen after leaving draft mode can add
descendants to the current theory.

<H3>Example</H3>

Suppose the following is the theory path when the hol90 system is started:
<PRE>
 - theory_path;
 val it =
   ref
    ["",
     "/hol/working/theories/ascii/",
     "/hol/working/library/fixpoint/theories/ascii/",
     "/hol/working/library/wellorder/theories/ascii/",
     "/hol/working/library/real/theories/ascii/",
     "/hol/working/library/pair/theories/ascii/",

     "/hol/working/library/set/theories/ascii/",
     "/hol/working/library/string/theories/ascii/"]
      : string list ref
</PRE>

The current theory is <KBD>HOL</KBD>. Now load the theory
<KBD>set</KBD>, which has the <KBD>HOL</KBD> theory as a parent.
<PRE>
 - load_theory "set";

 Loading theory "set"
 Theory "HOL" already consistent with disk, hence not exported.
 val it = () : unit
</PRE>
Now try to load the theory <KBD>string</KBD>. You can't! Why? Because
<KBD>string</KBD> does not have <KBD>set</KBD> as a parent.
<PRE>
  - load_theory "string" handle e => Raise e;

  Loading theory "string"
  Theory "set" already consistent with disk, hence not exported.

<H3>Another example</H3>

A user asked:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
In hol90, is it possible to build four theories with the following
dependence structure in one single SML session?
<PRE>
      a
     /  \
    b    c
     \  /
      d
</PRE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

The answer is "No", although the hol90 implementors are thinking of
changing the implementation so that this example is possible. To build
<KBD>b</KBD>, you need to do a <KBD>new_theory</KBD> when in theory
<KBD>a</KBD>. Likewise with building <KBD>c</KBD>. However, when you do
a <KBD>new_theory</KBD>, you advance along in the partial order and you
can't go back. Also, you can't have two independent theories in the same
session, unless they are in the ancestry of the current theory. To get
the picture above, you could build <KBD>b</KBD> and <KBD>c</KBD> in
separate sessions, and then, in a third session, <KBD>load_theory</KBD> on
either <KBD>b</KBD> or <KBD>c</KBD>, and then do a <KBD>new_theory
"d"</KBD>, followed by a <KBD>new_parent</KBD> on <KBD>b</KBD> or
<KBD>c</KBD>, depending on which was not in the ancestry of <KBD>d</KBD>.

<H2><A NAME = "Theories and the file system">
              Theories and the file system</A></H2>

HOL supports persistent theories: once a user has finished working on a
theory, it can be written out to a file, to be loaded or extended at a
later date. The current theory is held in the ML heap, but the large
number of theories in the HOL system implies that they usually do not
all need to be in the heap at the same time. Theory operations make use
of the <A HREF = "manual.html#Paths"><EM>theory path</EM></A> to
manipulate theories that are on disk.

<PRE>
    (* Operations that write the theory to disk *)
    val export_theory : unit -> unit
    val close : unit -> unit
</PRE>

In hol88, the Lisp artifact <KBD>quit</KBD> is used to end a session. If
the session is in draft mode, this has the side-effect of writing the
current theory to disk. In hol90, <KBD>quit</KBD> is not implemented;
instead, <KBD>export_theory</KBD> will write the current theory to
disk. Until it is called, the disk file will not be written (or even
opened). Ending a session with hol90 is via ^D.  If you are building a
theory and hit ^D before calling <KBD>export_theory</KBD>, no work will
be saved on a theory file, since there won't even be a theory file!

<H3><A NAME = "Autoloading">Autoloading</A></H3>

In hol90, hol88-style <EM>autoloading</EM> is not available. The
replacement for it is found in the structure <KBD>Add_to_sml</KBD>.

<PRE>
    val add_to_sml : (string * thm) list -> unit
    val add_axioms_to_sml : string -> unit
    val add_definitions_to_sml : string -> unit
    val add_theorems_to_sml : string -> unit
    val add_theory_to_sml : string -> unit
</PRE>

These calls map theory-level bindings which are of type <KBD>string *
thm</KBD> to SML-level bindings. Their argument string must be an
ancestor of the current theory. For example,

<PRE>
    - Add_to_sml.add_definitions_to_sml "one";
    val one_DEF = |- one = (@x. T) : thm
    val oneTY_DEF = |- ?rep. TYPE_DEFINITION (\b. b) rep : thm
    val it = () : unit
    -
</PRE>
One can declare which bindings in a theory are to be reflected into SML
by using the function
<PRE>
    set_autoloads : autoload_info -> unit
</PRE>
where <KBD>autoload_info</KBD> is a type abbreviation:
<PRE>
    type autoload_info = {Theory : string,
                          Axioms : string list,
                          Definitions : string list,

<H2><A NAME = "Cache">The theory cache</A></H2>

The <EM>theory cache</EM> is a crude "virtual memory" mechanism at the
level of theories. Typically, only the minimum information is kept
internally for an ancestor theory. However, once the user requests any
information about an ancestor, <EM>e.g.</EM>, the definitions that have
been made in it, <EM>all</EM> the information about that theory is
loaded into the theory cache. This can have deleterious effects on the
amount of memory available to do proofs in, particularly if the user only
needs a small bit of the theory. Therefore, we provide some user control
over the theory cache.

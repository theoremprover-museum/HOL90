@\DOC P_PCHOOSE_THEN

\TYPE {P_PCHOOSE_THEN : (term -> thm_tactical)}

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, quantifier, existential.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Replaces existentially quantified pair with given witness,
and passes it to a theorem-tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{P_PCHOOSE_THEN} expects a pair {q}, a tactic-generating function
{f:thm->tactic}, and a theorem of the form {(A1 |- ?p. u)} as
arguments.  A new theorem is created by introducing the given pair
{q} as a witness for the pair {p} whose existence is asserted in the original
theorem, {(u[q/p] |- u[q/p])}.  If the tactic-generating function {f}
applied to this theorem produces results as follows when applied to a
goal {(A ?- u)}:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  f ({{u[q/p]}} |- u[q/p])
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent then applying {(P_PCHOOSE_THEN "q" f (A1 |- ?p. u))} to the
goal {(A ?- t)} produces the subgoal:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  P_PCHOOSE_THEN "q" f (A1 |- ?p. u)
    A ?- t1         ("q" not free anywhere)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not existentially quantified, or if
the first argument is not a paired structure of variables.  
Failures may arise in the tactic-generating function.  
An invalid tactic is produced if the introduced variable is free in {u} or {t},
or if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an
assumption of the goal.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

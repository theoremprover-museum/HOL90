\TYPE {RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly resolves a restricted universally quantified theorem with
the assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, resolution, restricted quantification.

\DESCRIBE
The function {RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC} performs repeatedly
resolution using a restricted quantified theorem.
It takes a restricted quantified theorem and transforms it into an
implication. This resulting theorem is used in the resolution.

Given a theorem {th}, the theorem-tactic {RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC}
applies {RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN} repeatedly to resolve the theorem with the
assumptions. 

\FAILURE
Never fails

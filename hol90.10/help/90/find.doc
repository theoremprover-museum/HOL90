\TYPE {Compat.find : ('a -> bool) -> 'a list -> 'a}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the first element of a list which satisfies a predicate.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. {find p [x1;...;xn]} returns the first {xi} 
in the list such that {(p xi)} is {true}. 

\FAILURE
Fails with {find} if no element satisfies the predicate. This will always be
the case if the list is empty.

\COMMENTS 
{find} is in Compat, because is is not found in hol90 ({Lib.first} is
equivalent and is used instead).

\SEEALSO
tryfind, mem, exists, forall, assoc, rev_assoc.

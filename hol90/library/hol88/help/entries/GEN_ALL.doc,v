@\DOC GEN_ALL

\TYPE {Compat.GEN_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem over its own free variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- t}, the inference rule {GEN_ALL} returns
the theorem {A |- !x1...xn. t}, where the {xi} are all the variables,
if any, which are free in {t} but not in the assumptions.
{
         A |- t
   ------------------  GEN_ALL
    A |- !x1...xn. t
}
\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENT
WARNING: hol90 GEN_ALL does not always return the same result as GEN_ALL 
in hol88. That is why GEN_ALL is in Compat. Sometimes people write code
that depends on the order of the quantification. They shouldn't.

\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DESCRIBE 
Eleminating Hilbert's choice operator.

The term @x.P x has to be given as argument. The tactic will then eliminate 
this term in Q and the subgoals above are obtained. This tactic only makes 
sense if G|-?x.P x holds. Otherwise the tactic SELECT_TAC should be used.
			
{		
	G |- Q(@x.P x)
==================================
G |- ?x.P x	G |- !y.P y==> Q y
}

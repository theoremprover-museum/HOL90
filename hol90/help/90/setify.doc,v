@\DOC setify

\TYPE {Compat.setify : ''a list -> ''a list}

\SYNOPSIS
{setify} makes a set out of an "eqtype" list.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. {setify l} removes repeated elements from
{l}, leaving the last occurrence of each duplicate in the list.

\FAILURE
Never fails. The function is not available unless the hol88 library has been 
loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - setify [1,2,3,1,4,3];
  [2,1,4,3] : int list
}
\COMMENTS
Perhaps the first occurrence of each duplicate should be left in the list, not
the last? However, other functions may rely on the ordering currently used.
Included in {Compat} because {setify} is not found in hol90 ({mk_set} is used 
instead.)

\SEEALSO
distinct.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

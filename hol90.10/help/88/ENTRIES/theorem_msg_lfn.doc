\DOC theorem_msg_lfn

\TYPE {theorem_msg_lfn : (string list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads a given theorem from a given theory, with an autoload message.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is an ancestor theory, and {th} one of its theorems, then the call
{
   theorem_msg_lfn [`thy`;`th`]
}
\noindent will print a message of the form
{
   Theorem th autoloaded from theory `thy`
}
\noindent and cancel any autoloading action associated with the name {th},
and will then return that theorem.

\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {th} is not one of its
theorems.

\EXAMPLE
{
#theorem_msg_lfn [`num`; `INV_SUC`];;
Theorem INV_SUC autoloaded from theory `num`.
|- !m n. (SUC m = SUC n) ==> (m = n)
}

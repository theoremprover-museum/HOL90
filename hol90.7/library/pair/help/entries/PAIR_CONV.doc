\TYPE {PAIR_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\KEYWORDS

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a conversion to all the components of a pair structure.

\DESCRIBE
For any conversion {c}, the function returned by {PAIR_CONV c} is a conversion
that applies {c} to all the components of a pair.
If the term {t} is not a pair, them {PAIR_CONV c t} applies {c} to {t}.
If the term {t} is the pair {(t1,t2)} then {PAIR c t} recursively applies
{PAIR_CONV c} to {t1} and {t2}.

\FAILURE
The conversion returned by {PAIR_CONV c} will fail for the pair structure {t}
if the conversion {c} would fail for any of the components of {t}.

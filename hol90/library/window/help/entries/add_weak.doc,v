@\DOC add_weak

\TYPE {add_weak : (thm -> unit)}

\SYNOPSIS
Adds a weakening rule to the window system tables.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
The window inference system can compensate for a missing window rule
in its database by substituting a rule which preserves a relation
which is stronger than the one the user wanted to preserve. To do
this, the system must know how to weaken a theorem where two terms
are related by the stronger relation to a theorem where the two terms are
related by the required relation.

The system already knows that equality is stronger than any reflexive
relation, and how to weaken a theorem which relates terms by equality
to a theorem which relates the terms by any reflexive relation.
Suppose you would like the system to know that the relation {"S"} is
stronger than the relation {"R"}. First you should define the
following theorem:
{
   WEAK_SR |- !x y. (x S y) ==> (x R y)
}
\noindent Next you add this theorem with the command
{add_weak WEAK_SR}. From this information system maintains lists of
which relationships may be substituted for which. Suppose we had
added to the system rules for weakening {"S"} to {"R"} and {"R"} to
{"Q"}, the system can infer that both {"R"} and {"S"} can be used as
substitutes for {"Q"}, but {"R"} is preferable since it is the weaker
of the two relations.

\FAILURE
{add_weak} will fail if you try to add a rule which duplicates
information already stored or inferred by the system. {add_weak} will
fail if you try to add a rule which would create a cycle in the list
of possible substitutes for a relation. {add_weak} will fail if you
try to add a rule which would create a branch in the list of possible
substitutes for a relation.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

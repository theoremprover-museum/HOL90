@\DOC SUBST_CONV

\TYPE {SUBST_CONV : ((thm # term) list -> term -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes substitutions in a term at selected occurrences of subterms, using a list
of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
conversion.

\DESCRIBE
{SUBST_CONV} implements the following rule of simultaneous substitution
{
                    A1 |- t1 = v1 ... An |- tn = vn
   ------------------------------------------------------------------
    A1 u ... u An |- t[t1,...,tn/x1,...,xn] = t[v1,...,vn/x1,...,xn]
}
\noindent The first argument to {SUBST_CONV} is a list
{[(A1|-t1=v1, x1);...;(An|-tn=vn, xn)]}.
The second argument is a template term {t[x1,...,xn]}, in which
the variables {x1,...,xn} are used to mark those places where
occurrences of {t1,...,tn} are to be replaced with the terms
{v1,...,vn}, respectively.
Thus, evaluating
{
   SUBST_CONV [(A1|-t1=v1, x1);...;(An|-tn=vn, xn)]
              t[x1,...,xn]
              t[t1,...,tn/x1,...,xn]
}
\noindent returns the theorem
{
   A1 u ... u An |- t[t1,...,tn/x1,...,xn] = t[v1,...,vn/x1,...,xn]
}
The occurrence of {ti} at the places marked by the variable
{xi} must be free (i.e. {ti} must not contain any bound variables).
{SUBST_CONV} automatically renames bound variables to prevent free
variables in {vi} becoming bound after substitution.

\FAILURE
{SUBST_CONV [(th1,x1);...;(thn,xn)] t[x1,...,xn] t'} fails if the conclusion of
any theorem {thi} in the list is not an equation; or if the template
{t[x1,...,xn]} does not match the term {t'}; or if and term {ti} in {t'}
marked by the variable {xi} in the template, is not identical to the left-hand
side of the conclusion of the theorem {thi}.

\EXAMPLE
The theorems
{
   #let thm0 = SPEC "0" ADD1 and thm1 = SPEC "1" ADD1;;
   thm0 = |- SUC 0 = 0 + 1
   thm1 = |- SUC 1 = 1 + 1
}
\noindent can be used to substitute selected occurrences of the terms {SUC 0}
and {SUC 1}
{
   #SUBST_CONV [(thm0,"x:num");(thm1,"y:num")]
   #           "(x + y) > SUC 1"
   #           "(SUC 0 + SUC 1) > SUC 1";;
   |- ((SUC 0) + (SUC 1)) > (SUC 1) = ((0 + 1) + (1 + 1)) > (SUC 1)
}
\USES
{SUBST_CONV} is used when substituting at selected occurrences of terms
and using rewriting rules/conversions is too extensive.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

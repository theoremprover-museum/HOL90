                HOL90.8
              ----------

A minor upgrade to HOL90 is available via ftp from Munich at

ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de/local/lehrstuhl/nipkow/slind/hol90/hol90.8.tar.gz

This version of HOL90 runs on SML/NJ 109 or greater; in particular, it
runs on the HPPA architecture. Please note that HOL90.8 will not build
on top of version 0.93 of SML/NJ without a bit of work. Changes to the
behaviour of the system are minor, amounting to a few bugfixes, so happy
users of HOL90.7 should feel no need to change unless they are
contemplating a move to SML/NJ 109 or its descendants.

Please send any problems with HOL90.8 to slind@@informatik.tu-muenchen.de.

Looking to the future, a more powerful version of HOL90 is currently
under development at Cambridge.

Konrad.

\label{theorems}

The sections that follow list all theorems in the \ml{wellorder} library,
including definitions. The theorems are grouped into definitions, lemmas, and
the four main theorems. When the \ml{wellorder} library is loaded, only the
definitions and four main theorems are set up to autoload when their names are
mentioned in \ML. Lemmas, if needed, may be recovered by using the
\ml{theorem} function provided by \ML. Note that all theorems are printed with
the interface map set up by {\tt set\_wo\_map} is in effect.

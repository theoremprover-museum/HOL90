 * FILE: core.sml
 * AUTHOR: Donald Syme
 *
 * The Core structure contains everything in levels 0 and 1 of the system.
 *
 * This structure may or may not be permanent.  It is used to avoid having to
 * explicitly open lots and lots of structures in the HOL libraries,
 * but the downside of this is that if any of the signatures in the
 * core system change, this will make all the libraries recompile - bummer.
 * Explicit opening is better, but it can take a long time to work out
 * which structures need opening when given a source code file
 * which relies on them all being open at the top level.

1.1
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

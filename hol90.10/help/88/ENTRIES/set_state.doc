\TYPE {set_state : (goalstack -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets the current proof state of the subgoal package to the one given.

\DESCRIBE
The function {set_state} is part of the subgoal package. It restores the
current proof state to one previously saved (using {get_state}). The restored
state will include all unproven subgoals or, if the original goal had been
proved before the state was saved, the corresponding theorem. The old proof
state is placed on the backup list. For a description of the subgoal package,
see  {set_goal}.

\USES
Providing additional backup. Pausing in the proof of a goal to allow  lemmas to
be proved. {set_state} is used in conjunction with {get_state}.

\EXAMPLE
The current state may be  bound to an ML variable ({main_proof} in this
example) using {get_state}.
{
   #g "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])";;
   "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

   () : void

   #let main_proof = get_state();;
   main_proof = - : goalstack
}
\noindent Other goals may now be set and proved. The proof state may later be
restored using {set_state} and the original proof continued.
{
   #set_state main_proof;;
   "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

   () : void
}

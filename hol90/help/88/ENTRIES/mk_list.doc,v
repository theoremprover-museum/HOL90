\TYPE {mk_list : ((term list # type) -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs object-level list from list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
{mk_list(["t1";...;"tn"],":ty")} returns {"[t1;...;tn]:(ty)list"}.
The type argument is required so that empty lists can be constructed.

\FAILURE
Fails with {mk_list} if any term in the list is not of the type specified as
the second argument.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

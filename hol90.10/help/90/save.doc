\TYPE {Compat.save : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Saves an executable version of HOL in its current state.

\DESCRIBE

Found in the hol88 library. The call {save "image"} will save an
executable core image, in a file called {image}, of HOL in its current
state. This means that if this image is subsequently executed instead of
the normal HOL, any bindings set up will be preserved.

\FAILURE
Will fail only in system-dependent ways, such as running out of disk space.
The function is not available unless the hol88 library has been loaded.

\USES
Avoiding the need to re-execute certain initializations, such as the
loading of libraries, every time HOL is run.

\COMMENTS
Note that a HOL image is rather large; exactly how large depends on the version
of Lisp and other factors, but it is usually a good many megabytes. 

{save} is not available in hol90; instead, there is {save_hol :string -> unit},
which will preserve certain start-up behaviours of the image (like displaying 
a banner, and loading the hol-init.sml file). Also, most standard ML 
implementations provide a call {exportML} which does exactly what {save} is 
documented to do.

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {q} and a theorem {A |- !p. t}, then {PSPEC} returns
the theorem {A |- t[q/p]}.
If necessary, variables will be renamed prior to the specialization to ensure
that {q} is free for {p} in {t}, that is,
no variables free in {q} become bound after substitution.
{
     A |- !p. t
   --------------  PSPEC "q"
    A |- t[q/p]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not a paired universal quantification,
or if {p} and {q} have different types.

\EXAMPLE
{PSPEC} specialised paired quantifications.
{
   #PSPEC "(1,2)" (ASSUME "!(x,y). (x + y) = (y + x)");;
   . |- 1 + 2 = 2 + 1
}
{PSPEC} treats paired structures of variables as variables and 
preserves structure accordingly.
{
   #PSPEC "x:*#*" (ASSUME "!(x:*,y:*). (x,y) = (x,y)");;
   . |- x = x
}

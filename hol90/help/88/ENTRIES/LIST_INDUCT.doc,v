@\DOC LIST_INDUCT

\TYPE {LIST_INDUCT : ((thm # thm) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs proof by structural induction on lists.

\KEYWORDS
rule, list, induction.

\DESCRIBE
The derived inference rule {LIST_INDUCT} implements the rule of mathematical
induction:
{
     A1 |- P[NIL/l]      A2 |- !t. P[t/l] ==> !h. P[CONS h t/l]
    ------------------------------------------------------------  LIST_INDUCT
                      A1 u A2 |- !l. P
}
\noindent When supplied with a theorem {A1 |- P[NIL]}, which asserts the base
case of a proof of the proposition {P[l]} by structural induction on the list
{l}, and the theorem
{
   A2 |- !t. P[t] ==> !h. P[CONS h t]
}
\noindent which asserts the step case in the induction on {l}, the inference
rule {LIST_INDUCT} returns {A1 u A2 |- !l. P[l]}.

\FAILURE
{LIST_INDUCT th1 th2} fails if the theorems {th1} and {th2} do not have the
forms {A1 |- P[NIL]} and {A2 |- !t. P[t] ==> !h. P[CONS h t]} respectively
(where the empty list {NIL} in {th1} and the list {CONS h t} in {th2} have
the same type).

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

PreScript:
I have replaced the PostScript figure, fig1.ps, with a LaTeX picture
mode equivalent that will permit this document to be formatted and
printed at any TeX installation.

This directory contains a paper which describes design tradeoffs of
MakeIndex.  It is written in LaTeX and contains a figure in PostScript
specifed in the psfig format.  Run LaTeX on the file ind.tex to obtain
a DVI file.  All style files involved are included in this directory.
To print it, you need to have a PostScript-based printer and the
DVI-to-PostScript driver must understand the psfig format.  A
PostScipt version of this paper, ind.ps, can be printed directly to a
PostScript printer.

This paper appears in Software: Practice and Experience, Vol 19, No.
9, Sep. 1988, pp. 897-915.  A more complete version is available as

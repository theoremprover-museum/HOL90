@\DOC top_goal

\TYPE {top_goal : (void -> goal)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the current goal of the subgoal package.

\DESCRIBE
The function {top_goal} is part of the subgoal package. It returns the top goal
of the goal stack in the current proof state.  For a description of the subgoal
package, see  {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
A call to {top_goal} will fail if there are no unproven goals. This could be
because no goal has been set using {set_goal} or because the last goal set has
been completely proved.

\USES
Examining the proof state after a proof fails.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

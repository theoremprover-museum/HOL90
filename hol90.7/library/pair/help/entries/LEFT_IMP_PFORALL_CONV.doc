\TYPE {LEFT_IMP_PFORALL_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, implication.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification of the antecedent outwards through an
implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(!p. t) ==> u}, the conversion
{LEFT_IMP_PFORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (!p. t) ==> u = (?p'. t[p'/p] ==> u)
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of the pair {p} that does not
contain any variables that appear free in the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {(!p. t) ==> u}.

@\DOC CHOOSE_THEN

\TYPE {CHOOSE_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a tactic generated from the body of existentially quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem-tactic {ttac}, an existentially quantified
theorem {A' |- ?x. t}, and a goal, {CHOOSE_THEN} applies the tactic {ttac
(t[x'/x] |- t[x'/x])} to the goal, where {x'} is a variant of {x} chosen not to
be free in the assumption list of the goal. Thus if:
{
    A ?- s1
   =========  ttac (t[x'/x] |- t[x'/x])
    B ?- s2
}
\noindent then
{
    A ?- s1
   ==========  CHOOSE_THEN ttac (A' |- ?x. t)
    B ?- s2
}
\noindent This is invalid unless {A'} is a subset of {A}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theorem is existentially quantified, or if the
resulting tactic fails when applied to the goal.

\EXAMPLE
This theorem-tactical and its relatives are very useful for using existentially
quantified theorems. For example one might use the inbuilt theorem
{
   LESS_ADD_1 = |- !m n. n < m ==> (?p. m = n + (p + 1))
}
\noindent to help solve the goal
{
   ?- x < y ==> 0 < y * y
}
\noindent by starting with the following tactic
{
   DISCH_THEN (CHOOSE_THEN SUBST1_TAC o MATCH_MP LESS_ADD_1)
}
\noindent which reduces the goal to
{
   ?- 0 < ((x + (p + 1)) * (x + (p + 1)))
}
\noindent which can then be finished off quite easily, by, for example:
{
   REWRITE_TAC[ADD_ASSOC; SYM (SPEC_ALL ADD1);
               MULT_CLAUSES; ADD_CLAUSES; LESS_0]
}
\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {install : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Informs HOL of the absolute pathname to the hol distribution directory.

\DESCRIBE
{install} reconfigures a running HOL system to a new root directory.  The
string argument to {install} should be the absolute path name to the
directory in which the HOL system is located. Executing
{
   install `/dir1/dir2/dir3/.../hol`;;
}
\noindent sets the internal HOL search path to:
{
   [``; `~/`; `/dir1/dir2/dir3/.../hol/theories/`]
}
\noindent In addition, {install} sets the internal search path used by HOL to
find the standard online help files and the internal search path used by HOL to
find libraries.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The effect persists only for the current HOL session. To change the image
permanently, use the {save} function after installation.

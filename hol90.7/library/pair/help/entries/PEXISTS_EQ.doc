\SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a theorem
whose conclusion is equational:
{
    A |- t1 = t2
}
the inference rule {PEXISTS_EQ} returns the theorem:
{
    A |- (?p. t1) = (?p. t2)
}
provided the none of the variables in {p} is not free in any of the
assumptions.
{
          A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------------  PEXISTS_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
    A |- (?p. t1) = (?p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational with both sides having type {bool},
or if the term is not a paired structure of variables, or if any variable in
the pair to be quantified over is free in any of the assumptions.

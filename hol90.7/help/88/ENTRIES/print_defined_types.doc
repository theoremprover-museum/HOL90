\TYPE {print_defined_types : (void -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints all currently defined ML types known to the system.

\DESCRIBE
The function prints all ML types defined by means of {lettype}. It also
lists all abstract types in the system. The printing of {lettype}
defined types can be suppressed by setting the flag {print_lettypes} to
{false}. The resulting suppression is only partial as only the outer
level of defined types is expanded.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

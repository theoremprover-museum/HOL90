@\DOC NOT_CONV

\TYPE {NOT_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies certain boolean negation expressions.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} corresponds to one of the forms given below, where {t} is an arbitrary
term of type {bool}, then {NOT_CONV tm} returns the corresponding theorem.
{
   NOT_CONV "~F"  = |-  ~F = T
   NOT_CONV "~T"  = |-  ~T = F
   NOT_CONV "~~t" = |- ~~t = t
}

\FAILURE
{NOT_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has one of the forms indicated above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#NOT_CONV "~~~~T";;
|- ~~~~T = ~~T

#NOT_CONV "~~T";;
|- ~~T = T

#NOT_CONV "~T";;
|- ~T = F
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

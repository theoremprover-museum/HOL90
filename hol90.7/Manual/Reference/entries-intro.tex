This chapter provides manual entries for all the pre-defined \ML\ identifiers
in the \HOL\ system, except the identifiers that are bound to pre-proved
theorems (for these, see chapter two).  These include: general-purpose
functions, such as functions for list processing, arithmetic, input/output, and
interface configuration; functions for processing the types and terms of the
\HOL\ logic, for setting up theories, and for using the subgoal package;
primitive and derived forward inference rules; and tactics and tacticals.  The
arrangement is alphabetical.

\TYPE {Compat.butlast : ('a list -> 'a list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the sub-list of a list consisting of all but the last element.

\DESCRIBE
{butlast [x1;...;xn]} returns {[x1;...;x(n-1)]}.

\FAILURE 
Fails if the list is empty. This function is unavailable unless the
{hol88} library has already been loaded.

\COMMENTS
Not in hol90, since it was never used in the implementation. However, 
{Lib.front_n_back} gives the functionality of both {last} and {butlast}.

\SEEALSO
last, front_n_back, hd, tl, el, null.

\TYPE {GPSPEC : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, genvars.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with unique pairs.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p1...pn. t}, where the number of universally
quantified variables may be zero, {GPSPEC} returns {A |- t[g1/p1]...[gn/pn]},
where the {gi} is paired structures of the same structure as {pi} and
made up of distinct variables , chosen by {genvar}.
{
        A |- !p1...pn. t
   -------------------------  GPSPEC
    A |- t[g1/p1]...[gn/pn]
}
\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
{GPSPEC} is useful in writing derived inference rules which need to specialize
theorems while avoiding using any variables that may be present elsewhere.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC search_path

\TYPE {search_path : (void -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the internal search path use by HOL to find files.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {search_path()} returns a list of strings representing the pathnames
of the directories that are searched when HOL makes access to files on disk
(using {load}, {compile}, {load_theory}, etc.). Although the search path can be
set to an arbitrary list of strings, each string in the search path is normally
expected to be either empty ({``}) or a pathname with `{/}' as its final
character.  When HOL looks for a file, the directories in the search path are
searched in the order in which they occur in the list returned by
{search_path}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
A typical search path is the following:
{
   #search_path();;
   [``; `~/`; `/usr/lib/hol/theories/`] : string list
}
\noindent With this search path, HOL first looks for a file in the current
working directory (the pathname represented by {``}), then in the user`s home
directory {`~/`}, and finally in the directory {`/usr/lib/hol/theories/`} (the
directory containing HOL`s built-in theories).

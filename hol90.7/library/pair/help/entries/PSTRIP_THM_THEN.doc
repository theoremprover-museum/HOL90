\SYNOPSIS
{PSTRIP_THM_THEN} applies the given theorem-tactic using the result of
stripping off one outer connective from the given theorem.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem-tactic {ttac}, a theorem {th} whose conclusion is a
conjunction, a disjunction or a paired existentially quantified term,
and a goal {(A,t)}, {STRIP_THM_THEN ttac th} first strips apart the 
conclusion of {th}, next applies {ttac} to the theorem(s) resulting from the
stripping and then applies the resulting tactic to the goal.

In particular, when stripping a conjunctive theorem {A'|- u /\ v}, the tactic
{
   ttac(u|-u) THEN ttac(v|-v)
}
\noindent resulting from applying {ttac} to the conjuncts, is applied to the
goal.  When stripping a disjunctive theorem {A'|- u \/ v}, the tactics
resulting from applying {ttac} to the disjuncts, are applied to split the goal
into two cases. That is, if
{
    A ?- t                           A ?- t
   =========  ttac (u|-u)    and    =========  ttac (v|-v)
    A ?- t1                          A ?- t2
}
\noindent then:
{
         A ?- t
   ================== PSTRIP_THM_THEN ttac (A'|- u \/ v)
    A ?- t1  A ?- t2
}
\noindent When stripping a paired existentially quantified theorem
{A'|- ?p. u}, the tactic resulting from applying {ttac} to the
body of the paired existential quantification, {ttac(u|-u)},
is applied to the goal.  
That is, if:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  ttac (u|-u)
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent then:
{
      A ?- t
   =============  PSTRIP_THM_THEN ttac (A'|- ?p. u)
      A ?- t1
}
The assumptions of the theorem being split are not added to the assumptions of
the goal(s) but are recorded in the proof.  If {A'} is not a subset of the
assumptions {A} of the goal (up to alpha-conversion), {PSTRIP_THM_THEN ttac th}
results in an invalid tactic.

\FAILURE
{PSTRIP_THM_THEN ttac th} fails if the conclusion of {th} is not a conjunction,
a disjunction or a paired  existentially quantification.  Failure also occurs
if the application of {ttac} fails, after stripping the outer connective from
the conclusion of {th}.

\USES
{PSTRIP_THM_THEN} is used enrich the assumptions of a goal with a stripped
version of a previously-proved theorem.

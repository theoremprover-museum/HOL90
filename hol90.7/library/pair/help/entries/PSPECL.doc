\TYPE {PSPECL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes zero or more pairs in the conclusion of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term list {[q1;...;qn]} and a theorem
{A |- !p1...pn. t}, the inference rule {SPECL} returns the theorem
{A |- t[q1/p1]...[qn/pn]}, where the substitutions are made
sequentially left-to-right in the same way as for {PSPEC}.
{
       A |- !p1...pn. t
   --------------------------  SPECL "[q1;...;qn]"
     A |- t[q1/p1]...[qn/pn]
}
\noindent It is permissible for the term-list to be empty, in which case
the application of {PSPECL} has no effect.

\FAILURE
Fails unless each of the terms is of the same type
as that of the appropriate quantified variable in the original
theorem.
Fails if the list of terms is longer than the number of quantified
pairs in the theorem.

\TYPE {top_thm : (void -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the theorem just proved using the subgoal package.

\DESCRIBE
The function {top_thm} is part of the subgoal package. A proof state of the
package consists of either  goal and justification stacks if a proof is in
progress or a theorem if a proof has just been completed. If the proof state
consists of a theorem, {top_thm} returns that theorem. For a description of the
subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

\FAILURE
{top_thm} will fail if the proof state does not hold a theorem. This will be
so either because no goal has been set or because a proof is in progress with
unproven subgoals.

\USES
Accessing the result of an interactive proof session with the subgoal package.

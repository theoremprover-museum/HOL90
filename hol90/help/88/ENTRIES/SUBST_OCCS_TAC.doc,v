@\DOC SUBST_OCCS_TAC

\TYPE {SUBST_OCCS_TAC : ((int list # thm) list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes substitutions in a goal at specific occurrences of a term, using a list
of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
Given a list {(l1,A1|-t1=u1),...,(ln,An|-tn=un)} and a goal {(A,t)},
{SUBST_OCCS_TAC} replaces each {ti} in {t} with {ui}, simultaneously,
at the occurrences specified by the integers in the list {li = [o1;...;ok]}
for each theorem {Ai|-ti=ui}.
{
              A ?- t
   =============================  SUBST_OCCS_TAC [(l1,A1|-t1=u1);...;
    A ?- t[u1,...,un/t1,...,tn]                                (ln,An|-tn=un)]
}
\noindent The assumptions of the theorems used to substitute with are not
added to the assumptions {A} of the goal, but they are recorded in the proof.
If any {Ai} is not a subset of {A} (up to alpha-conversion),
{SUBST_OCCS_TAC [(l1,A1|-t1=u1);...;(ln,An|-tn=un)]}
results in an invalid tactic.

{SUBST_OCCS_TAC} automatically renames bound variables to prevent
free variables in {ui} becoming bound after substitution.

\FAILURE
{SUBST_OCCS_TAC [(l1,th1);...;(ln,thn)] (A,t)} fails if the conclusion of any
theorem in the list is not an equation.  No change is made to the goal if the
supplied occurrences {li} of the left-hand side of the conclusion of {thi} do
not appear in {t}.

\EXAMPLE
When trying to solve the goal
{
   ?- (m + n) + (n + m) = (m + n) + (m + n)
}
\noindent applying the commutative law for addition on the third occurrence of
the subterm {m + n}
{
   SUBST_OCCS_TAC [([3],SPECL ["m:num"; "n:num"] ADD_SYM)]
}
\noindent results in the goal
{
   ?- (m + n) + (n + m) = (m + n) + (n + m)
}
\USES
{SUBST_OCCS_TAC} is used when rewriting a goal at specific occurrences
of a term,
and rewriting tactics such as {REWRITE_TAC}, {PURE_REWRITE_TAC},
{ONCE_REWRITE_TAC}, {SUBST_TAC}, etc. are too extensive or would diverge.

\SEEALSO
ONCE_REWRITE_TAC, PURE_REWRITE_TAC, REWRITE_TAC, SUBST1_TAC, SUBST_TAC.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

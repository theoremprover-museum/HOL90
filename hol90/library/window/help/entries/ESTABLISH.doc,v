@\DOC ESTABLISH

\TYPE {ESTABLISH : (term -> win_stack -> win_stack)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prove a new lemma, or establish a conjecture.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{ESTABLISH tm} pushes a subwindow with focus {tm} onto a window stack.
If {tm} is a conjecture in the parent window, it (and any lemmas that
depend on it) will be removed from the subwindow.  The relationship
preserved in the subwindow is {`<==`}.  The user should then transform
the focus of the subwindow from {tm} to {`T`}(true).  The subwindow
should then be closed making {tm} a lemma of the parent window.

\FAILURE
{ESTABLISH} will fail if the window stack is empty.

\noindent Attempts to use {CLOSE_WIN} on a window opened by
{ESTABLISH} and whose focus has not been transformed to {`T`} will
fail.  If the focus can not be proved you can abandon the proof
attempt with {UNDO_WIN}.

\EXAMPLE
{
   = * f
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (ESTABLISH (--`A \/ ~A`--));
   
   <== * A \/ ~A
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (REWRITE_WIN [EXCLUDED_MIDDLE]);
   
   <== * T
   val it = () : unit
   - DO CLOSE_WIN;
   
     | A \/ ~A
   = * f
   val it = () : unit
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

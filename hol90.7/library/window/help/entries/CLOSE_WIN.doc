\DOC CLOSE_WIN

\TYPE {CLOSE_WIN : (win_stack -> win_stack)}

\SYNOPSIS
Pop the top window from the stack and transform the parent window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{CLOSE_WIN} removes the top window from a window stack and uses the
theorem in that window to transform the parent window. {CLOSE_WIN} is
used to close subwindows opened by the {OPEN_WIN}, {OPEN_CONTEXT} and
{ESTABLISH} commands.

\FAILURE
{CLOSE_WIN} will fail if the stack is empty or is only one window
deep. Other possible failures depend on the command used to open the
window.

\EXAMPLE
{
   - BEGIN_STACK "example" (--`($<==) (A /\ (B /\ F))`--) [] [];
   
   <== * A /\ B /\ F
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (OPEN_WIN [RAND]);
   
       ! A
   <== * B /\ F
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (REWRITE_WIN []);
   
       ! A
   <== * F
   val it = () : unit
   - DO CLOSE_WIN;
   
   <== * A /\ F
   val it = () : unit
   - END_STACK "example";
   val it = () : unit
}

\DOC IMP_TRANS

\TYPE {IMP_TRANS : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Implements the transitivity of implication.

\KEYWORDS
rule, implication, transitivity.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- t1 ==> t2} and {A2 |- t2 ==> t3},
the inference rule {IMP_TRANS} returns the theorem {A1 u A2 |- t1 ==> t3}.
{
    A1 |- t1 ==> t2   A2 |- t2 ==> t3
   -----------------------------------  IMP_TRANS
         A1 u A2 |- t1 ==> t3
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorems are both implicative, with the consequent of the
first being the same as the antecedent of the  second (up to alpha-conversion).

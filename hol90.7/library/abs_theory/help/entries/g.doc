\TYPE {g : (term -> void)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Initializes the subgoal package with a new goal which has no assumptions
except those created from the theory obligations.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   g "tm"
}
\noindent is equivalent to
{
   set_abs_goal([],"tm")
}
\noindent 
and clearly more convenient if a goal has no assumptions.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_abs_goal}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

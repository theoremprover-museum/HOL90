@\DOC SUBGOAL_THEN

\TYPE {SUBGOAL_THEN : (term -> thm_tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Allows the user to introduce a lemma.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, lemma.

\DESCRIBE
The user proposes a lemma and is then invited to prove it under
the current assumptions.
The lemma is then used with the {thm_tactic} to simplify the goal.
That is, if
{
    A1 ?- t1
   ==========  f (u |- u)
    A2 ?- t2
}
\noindent then
{
         A1 ?- t1
   ====================  SUBGOAL_THEN "u" f
    A1 ?- u   A2 ?- t2
}
\FAILURE
{SUBGOAL_THEN} will fail with {`ASSUME`} if an attempt is made to use a
nonboolean term as a lemma.

\USES
When combined with {rotate}, {SUBGOAL_THEN} allows the user to defer some
part of a proof and to continue with another part.
{SUBGOAL_THEN} is most convenient when the tactic solves the original goal,
leaving only the subgoal.
For example, suppose the user wishes top prove the goal
{
   {{n = SUC m}} ?- (0 = n) ==> t
}
Using {SUBGOAL_THEN} to focus on the case in which {~(n = 0)},
rewriting establishes it truth, leaving only the proof that {~(n = 0)}.
That is,
{
   SUBGOAL_THEN "~(0 = n)" (\th:thm. REWRITE_TAC [th])
}
\noindent generates the following subgoals:
{
   {{n = SUC m}} ?-  ~(0 = n)
   ?- T
}
\COMMENTS
Some users may expect the generated tactic to be {f (A1 |- u)}, rather than
{f (u |- u)}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

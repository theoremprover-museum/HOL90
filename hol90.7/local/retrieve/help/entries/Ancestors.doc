\DESCRIBE
A {searchpath} is either a single theory segment, or it is a hierarchy of
theory segments. The latter is specified by a pair of lists. The theory
segments in the first list and all of their ancestors will be searched in a
breadth-first manner. No theory segment will be searched more than once. The
second list can be used to specify exclusions. Any theory segment in the
exclusion list or any ancestors of those theory segments will not be searched
unless they can be reached by a route which does not go through a theory
segment in the exclusion list. A {searchpath} is generated from the pair of
lists by applying the function {Ancestors}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

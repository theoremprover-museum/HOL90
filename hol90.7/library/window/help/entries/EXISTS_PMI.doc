\TYPE {EXISTS_PMI : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies the clauses of a backward implication.

\LIBRARY window

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a variable {`x`} and a theorem {A |- t1 <== t2}, the
{EXISTS_PMI} inference rule returns the theorem
{A |- (?x. t1) <== (?x. t2)}, provided {`x`} is not free in the
assumptions.
{
         A |- t1 <== t2
    ------------------------ EXISTS_IMP `x` [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (?x.t1) <== (?x.t2)
}

\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not a backward implication, or if the term is
not a variable, or if the term is a variable but is free in the
assumption list.

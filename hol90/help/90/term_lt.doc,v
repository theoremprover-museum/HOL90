@\DOC term_lt

\TYPE {term_lt : term -> term -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
A total ordering function on terms.

\DESCRIBE
{term_lt} tells whether one term is less than another in the ordering.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
    - term_lt (--`\x.x = T`--) (--`3 + 4`--)
    val it = false : bool
}

\COMMENTS
If {not (term_lt tm1 tm2)} and {not (term_lt tm2 tm1)}, then {tm1 = tm2}, 
although it is faster to directly test for equality. Ordering of terms may 
be useful in implementing search trees and the like.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

| HOL DISTRIBUTION DIRECTORY: Covers					|
+ ===================================================================== +



This directory contains the LaTeX source for the fancy cover pages for
the HOL manual.  

These pages are full of PostScript inclusions, and are useless to you
if you don't have a PostScript printer.  The psfig macros are also required.  
If you don't already have them, see the subdirectory psfig for details on 
installing the package.

You will have to edit the definition of some variables in the Makefile in 
this subdirectory (Covers) to make things work properly.  The psfig macros 
are assumed to be on the standard TeX include path.

Once the above requirements have been met, simply typing "make all" at
the Unix prompt should set things up.  You may then print the files
titlepages.ps and endpages.ps to your PostScript printer.

As usual, "make clean" and "make clobber" are also provided.

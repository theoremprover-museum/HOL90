 * AUTHOR: Donald Syme
 *
 * The Core structure contains everything in levels 0 and 1 of the system.
 *
 * This structure may or may not be permanent.  It is used to avoid having to
 * explicitly open lots and lots of structures in the HOL libraries,
 * but the downside of this is that if any of the signatures in the
 * core system change, this will make all the libraries recompile - bummer.
 * Explicit opening is better, but it can take a long time to work out
 * which structures need opening when given a source code file
 * which relies on them all being open at the top level.

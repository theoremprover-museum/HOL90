@\DOC hide_constant

\TYPE {hide_constant : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Stops the quotation parser from recognizing a constant.

\DESCRIBE
A call {hide_constant `c`} where {c} is the name of a constant, will
prevent the quotation parser from parsing it as such; it will just be parsed as
a variable. The effect can be reversed by {unhide_constant `c`}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the given name is not a constant of the current theory, or if the
named constant is already hidden.

\COMMENTS
The hiding of a constant only affects the quotation parser; the constant is
still there in a theory, and may not be redefined.

\SEEALSO
unhide_constant.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

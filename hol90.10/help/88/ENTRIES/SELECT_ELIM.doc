\DOC SELECT_ELIM

\TYPE {SELECT_ELIM : (thm -> (term # thm) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Eliminates an epsilon term, using deduction from a particular instance.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\DESCRIBE
{SELECT_ELIM} expects two arguments, a theorem {th1}, and a pair
{(v,th2):(term # thm)}.  The conclusion of {th1} must have the form {P($@ P)},
which asserts that the epsilon term {$@ P} denotes some value at which
{P} holds.  The variable {v} appears only in the assumption {P v} of
the theorem {th2}.  The conclusion of the resulting theorem matches
that of {th2}, and the hypotheses include the union of all hypotheses
of the premises excepting {P v}.
{
    A1 |- P($@ P)     A2 u {{P v}} |- t
   -----------------------------------  SELECT_ELIM th1 (v,th2)
              A1 u A2 |- t
}
\noindent where {v} is not free in {A2}. If {v} appears in the conclusion of
{th2}, the epsilon term will NOT be eliminated, and the conclusion will be
{t[$@ P/v]}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first theorem is not of the form {A1 |- P($@ P)}, or if
the variable {v} occurs free in any other assumption of {th2}.

\EXAMPLE
If a property of functions is defined by:
{
   INCR = |- !f. INCR f = (!t1 t2. t1 < t2 ==> (f t1) < (f t2))
}
\noindent The following theorem can be proved.
{
   th1 = |- INCR(@f. INCR f)
}
\noindent Additionally, if such a function is assumed to exist, then one
can prove that there also exists a function which is injective (one-to-one) but
not surjective (onto).
{
   th2 = [ INCR g ] |- ?h. ONE_ONE h /\ ~ONTO h
}
\noindent These two results may be combined using {SELECT_ELIM} to
give a new theorem:
{
   #SELECT_ELIM th1 ("g:num->num", th2);;
   |- ?h. ONE_ONE h /\ ~ONTO h
}
\USES
This rule is rarely used.  The equivalence of {P($@ P)} and {$? P}
makes this rule fundamentally similar to the {?}-elimination rule {CHOOSE}.

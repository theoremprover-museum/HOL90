\TYPE {subst : ((term # term) list -> term -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Substitutes terms in a term.

\DESCRIBE
Given a list of term pairs {[("a_1","b_1"),...,("a_n","b_n")]}
and a term {"c"}, {subst} attempts to substitute  all free occurrences of
{"b_i"} in {"c"} by {"a_i"} for all {i} ranging between {1} and {n}.

\FAILURE
Failure occurs if for some {i} ranging between {1} and {n}, the substitution
of {"b_i"} by {"a_i"} fails.
The substitution of  {"b_i"} by {"a_i"} fails for some {i},
if the types of {"a_i"} and  {"b_i"} are not the same.

\EXAMPLE
{
   #subst [("1","SUC 0")] "SUC(SUC 0)";;
   "SUC 1" : term

   #subst [("1","SUC 0");("2","SUC 1")] "SUC(SUC 0)";;
   "SUC 1" : term

   #subst [("1","SUC 0");("2","SUC 1")] "SUC(SUC 0) = SUC 1";;
   "SUC 1 = 2" : term

   #subst [("b:num","a:num")] "\a:num. (b:num)";;
   "\a. b" : term

   #subst [("foo:*","flip:*")] "waddle:*";;
   "waddle" : term
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\SYNOPSIS
Creates a new predicate constant.

\DESCRIBE
The call

   new_predicate(`P`,":ty")
}
\noindent will declare a new predicate called {P} on type {ty}, that is, a
constant {P} of type {ty->bool}.

corresponding name in the current theory segment.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

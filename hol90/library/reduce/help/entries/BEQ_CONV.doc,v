@\DOC BEQ_CONV

\TYPE {BEQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Simplifies certain expressions involving boolean equality.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} corresponds to one of the forms given below, where {t} is an arbitrary
term of type {bool}, then {BEQ_CONV tm} returns the corresponding theorem. Note
that in the last case the left-hand and right-hand sides need only be
alpha-equivalent rather than strictly identical.
{
   BEQ_CONV "T = t" = |- T = t = t
   BEQ_CONV "t = T" = |- t = T = t
   BEQ_CONV "F = t" = |- F = t = ~t
   BEQ_CONV "t = F" = |- t = F = ~t
   BEQ_CONV "t = t" = |- t = t = T
}

\FAILURE
{BEQ_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has one of the forms indicated above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#BEQ_CONV "T = T";;
|- (T = T) = T

#BEQ_CONV "F = T";;
|- (F = T) = F

#BEQ_CONV "(!x:*#**. x = (FST x,SND x)) = (!y:*#**. y = (FST y,SND y))";;
|- ((!x. x = FST x,SND x) = (!y. y = FST y,SND y)) = T
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC REDUCE_TAC

\TYPE {REDUCE_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs arithmetic or boolean reduction on a goal at all levels possible.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
{REDUCE_TAC} attempts to transform a goal by applying {REDUCE_CONV}.
It will prove any true goal which is constructed from numerals and the boolean
constants {T} and {F}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may not advance the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The following example takes a couple of minutes' CPU time:

{
   #g "((1 EXP 3) + (12 EXP 3) = 1729) /\ ((9 EXP 3) + (10 EXP 3) = 1729)";;
   "((1 EXP 3) + (12 EXP 3) = 1729) /\ ((9 EXP 3) + (10 EXP 3) = 1729)"

   () : void

   #e REDUCE_TAC;;
   OK..
   goal proved
   |- ((1 EXP 3) + (12 EXP 3) = 1729) /\ ((9 EXP 3) + (10 EXP 3) = 1729)

   Previous subproof:
   goal proved
   () : void
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

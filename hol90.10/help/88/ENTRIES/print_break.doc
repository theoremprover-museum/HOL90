\TYPE {print_break : ((int # int) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks a pretty printing block into parts.

\DESCRIBE
The function {print_break} is used within the print formatting block
formed by either {print_begin} or {print_ibegin} and {print_end}. It is used
to indicate points where breaks can occur within a list being printed. The
function takes two integer arguments, the first indicating the width
of the break and the second specifying an offset to be used if
wrapping has to be done.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
We first set the margin to 13 by:
{
   #set_margin 13;;
   72 : int
}
\noindent A simple formatting action is done in the ML segment given below:
{
   #let  example =
      (print_begin 0;
       print_string `first`;
       print_break (1,2);
       print_string `second`;
       print_break (1,2);
       print_end());;
}
\noindent In this fragment of code {print_break} is used to put a single
space  between the strings. However if wrapping occurs, {print_break}
indents the following line by two spaces. The result of this fragment is:
{
   first second example =
   ()
   : void
}
\noindent If we now change the margin to 10 and execute the same fragment (not
given):
{
   #set_margin 10;;
   13 : int
}
\noindent The result is wrapped with an indent of two character spaces from the
left.
{
   first
     second
     example =
   ()
   : void
}
\noindent Wrapping took place due to the new margin setting.

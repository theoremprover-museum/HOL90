@\DOC RESQ_RES_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_RES_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Enriches assumptions by repeatedly resolving restricted universal
quantifications in them against the others.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, resolution, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
{RESQ_RES_TAC} uses those assumptions which are restricted universal
quantifications in resolution in a way similar to {RES_TAC}. It calls
{RESQ_RES_THEN} repeatedly until there is no more resolution can be done.
The conclusions of all the new results are returned as additional
assumptions of the subgoal(s).  The effect of {RESQ_RES_TAC} 
on a goal is to enrich the assumption set with some of its collective
consequences.


\FAILURE
{RESQ_RES_TAC} cannot fail and so should not be unconditionally {REPEAT}ed.

\SEEALSO
RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC, RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN, RESQ_RES_THEN,
IMP_RES_TAC, IMP_RES_THEN, RES_CANON, RES_THEN, RES_TAC.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC ALL_THEN

\TYPE {ALL_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Passes a theorem unchanged to a theorem-tactic.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, identity.

\DESCRIBE
For any theorem-tactic {ttac} and theorem {th}, the application {ALL_THEN ttac
th} results simply in {ttac th}, that is, the theorem is passed unchanged to
the theorem-tactic. {ALL_THEN} is the identity theorem-tactical.

\FAILURE
The application of {ALL_THEN} to a theorem-tactic never fails. The resulting
theorem-tactic fails under exactly the same conditions as the original one.

\USES
Writing compound tactics or tacticals, e.g. terminating list iterations
of theorem-tacticals.

\SEEALSO
ALL_TAC, FAIL_TAC, NO_TAC, NO_THEN, THEN_TCL, ORELSE_TCL.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE

\TYPE {FILTER_PURE_ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE : ((term -> bool) -> thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a theorem once using some of its assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
rule, selective.

\DESCRIBE
The first argument is a predicate applied to the assumptions. The theorem is
rewritten with the assumptions for which the predicate returns {true} and the
given list of theorems. It searches the term of the theorem once, without
applying rewrites recursively. Thus it avoids the divergence which can result
from the application of {FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_RULE}. For more information
on rewriting rules, see {GEN_REWRITE_RULE}.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
This function is useful when rewriting with a subset of assumptions of
a theorem, allowing control of the number of rewriting passes.

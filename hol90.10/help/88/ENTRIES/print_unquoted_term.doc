\DOC print_unquoted_term

\TYPE {print_unquoted_term : (term -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a HOL term to the terminal without surrounding quotes.

\DESCRIBE
{print_unquoted_term tm} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing
the value of {tm} to the terminal without surrounding quotes. The text is not
terminated with a carriage return. In fact, the text is queued until the
pretty-printer decides where line breaks are needed, or until the queue is
explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_unquoted_term "x /\ y";;
x /\ y() : void
}

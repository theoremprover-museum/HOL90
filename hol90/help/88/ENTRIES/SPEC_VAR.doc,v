@\DOC SPEC_VAR

\TYPE {SPEC_VAR : (thm -> (term # thm))}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem, returning the chosen variant.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x. t}, the inference rule {SPEC_VAR} returns
the term {x'} and the theorem {A |- t[x'/x]}, where {x'} is a variant
of {x} chosen to avoid free variable capture.
{
     A |- !x. t
   --------------  SPEC_VAR
    A |- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem's conclusion is universally quantified.

\COMMENTS
This rule is very similar to plain {SPEC}, except that it returns the
variant chosen, which may be useful information under some circumstances.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

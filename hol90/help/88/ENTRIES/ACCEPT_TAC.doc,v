@\DOC ACCEPT_TAC

\TYPE {ACCEPT_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Solves a goal if supplied with the desired theorem (up to alpha-conversion).

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{ACCEPT_TAC} maps a given theorem {th} to a tactic that solves any goal whose
conclusion is alpha-convertible to the conclusion of {th}.

\FAILURE
{ACCEPT_TAC th (A,g)} fails if the term {g} is not alpha-convertible to the
conclusion of the supplied theorem {th}.

\EXAMPLE
{ACCEPT_TAC} applied to the axiom
{
   BOOL_CASES_AX = |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F)
}
\noindent will solve the goal
{
   ?- !x. (x = T) \/ (x = F)
}
\noindent but will fail on the goal
{
   ?- !x. (x = F) \/ (x = T)
}
\USES
Used for completing proofs by supplying an existing theorem, such as an axiom,
or a lemma already proved.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

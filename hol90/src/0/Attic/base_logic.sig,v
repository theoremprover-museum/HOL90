@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

@Keeping you up to date:

I'm about to do a checkin of elsa's modifications to the hol90.7
sources to create her hol90.pre8.  To recap what I've done:
	- I checked out hol90 (in /usr/groups/hol/drs1004/hol90)
		cvs co hol90
	  (Well, to be honest, I only checked out those
	  parts of hol90 I knew I'd be changing, e.g. not the
	  Manual, and only parts of the library.  Checking out the
	  entire source takes a while, mainly due to the enormous number
	  of help files.  The limiting factor is files/second, which
         runs at around 5 when CVS is working on nfs over a network, not
         KB/second, which you might at first think it would be).

	- By doing a recursive diff between Elsa's source and the
	hol90.7 source I found all the changes Elsa had made to
	source files.  I copied relevant files from Elsa's source
	into my checked out version.  The only new files were
		- the sml_system files in src/0
		- some make scripts in src/.
	Changed files were in:
		src/{0,1,2,3}
		library/arith/src/thm_convs.sml
		library/list/src/list_conv1.sml
		library/num/src/num_lib.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/halts_logic.sml
		library/prog_logic/src/translation.sml
		library/prog_logic/theories/src/mk_halts.sml
		library/real/theories/src/Make
		library/real/theories/src/equiv.sml
		library/real/theories/src/seq.sml
		library/reduce/src/arithconv.sml
		library/string/src/string_conv.sml
		library/unity/theories/src/aux_definitions.sml
		library/word/theories/src/*

	- I will now commit these changes, with this email as the log message.
		cvs commit

	- Tomorrow I will get this version compiling
	with NJSML 108 (I will probably add
	the files to enable the NJSML compilation manager to make
	this easier), then check those changes in.  I think it's
	good to get things in a working state.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

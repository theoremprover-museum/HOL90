@\DOC new_type_abbrev

\TYPE {new_type_abbrev : ((string # type) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets up a new type abbreviation.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_type_abbrev(`ab`,":ty")} creates and stores in the current theory
segment a new type abbreviation {ab} for the type {ty}. In future, {":ab"} may
be used rather than the perhaps complicated expresion {":ty"}.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode.

\EXAMPLE
{
#new_theory `gonk`;;
() : void

#new_type_abbrev(`bt`,":bool#bool#bool");;
() : void

#let tm = "x:bt" and ty = ":bt";;
tm = "x" : term
ty = ":bool # (bool # bool)" : type

#type_of tm = ty;;
true : bool
}
\COMMENTS
A similar mechanism can be implemented using antiquotation, for example:
{
   #let bt = ":bool#bool#bool";;
   bt = ":bool # (bool # bool)" : type

   #let tm = "x:^bt" and ty = ":^bt";;
   tm = "x" : term
   ty = ":bool # (bool # bool)" : type

   #type_of tm = ty;;
   true : bool
}
\noindent although this does have the disadvantage of not being stored in the
theory file.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

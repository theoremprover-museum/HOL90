@This directory is for the odds and ends attached to hol90.

Contents.

doc-to-help.sed   - the hol90 "help" function uses this to format its output.
                    Taken from the hol88 release.

howto.yak         - a short and simple introduction to ML-Yacc

ml-conv.el        - a small set of gnu_emacs lisp functions for the rough 
                    conversion of ML Classic to SML. Works best on files 
                    consisting mainly of proofs. If you can make any 
                    improvements, send them to slind@@informatik.tu-muenchen.de

resituate_hol90   - a shell script useful when moving the hol90 root directory 
                    after building the system.

Xhelp             - a directory containing Sara Kalvala's xholhelp tool, with 
                    improvements by Matthew Morley.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

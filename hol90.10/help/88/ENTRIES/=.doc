\TYPE {$= : ((* # *) -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs an equality test on two ML values.

\KEYWORDS
equality.

\DESCRIBE
{$=} works as expected on non-function types.  It may give unexpected results
when applied to function types (or types containing them, such as a pair of
functions), and should be considered unreliable in those situations.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#1 = 2;;
false : bool

#1 = 1;;
true : bool

#let f x = x + 1 and g x = x + 2;;
f = - : (int -> int)
g = - : (int -> int)

#let f' = f and h x = f x and h' x = x + 1;;
f' = - : (int -> int)
h = - : (int -> int)
h' = - : (int -> int)

#f=f;;
true : bool

#f = f';;
true : bool

#f = g;;
false : bool

#f =h;;
false : bool

#f=h';;
false : bool

#h = h';;
false : bool
}

@\DOC SELECT_RULE

\TYPE {SELECT_RULE : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces an epsilon term in place of an existential quantifier.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {SELECT_RULE} expects a theorem asserting the
existence of a value {x} such that {P} holds.  The equivalent assertion
that the epsilon term {@@x.P} denotes a value of {x} for
which {P} holds is returned as a theorem.
{
       A |- ?x. P
   ------------------  SELECT_RULE
    A |- P[(@@x.P)/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
existentially quantified.

\EXAMPLE
The axiom {INFINITY_AX} in the theory {ind} is of the form:
{
   |- ?f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f
}
\noindent Applying {SELECT_RULE} to this theorem returns the following.
{
   #SELECT_RULE INFINITY_AX;;
   |- ONE_ONE(@@f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f) /\ ~ONTO(@@f. ONE_ONE f /\ ~ONTO f)
}
\USES
May be used to introduce an epsilon term to permit rewriting with a
constant defined using the epsilon operator.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {new_abs_parent : (string -> void)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Extends the current theory with a new abstract parent theory.

\DESCRIBE 

Executing {new_abs_parent `thy`} extends the current theory by making the
existing abstract theory named  {thy} a parent of the current theory
segment. The extended theory contains the theory segments of both
constituent theories and any theory obligations declared in the parent.
The theory  {thy} is loaded into the system. The message ` {Theory thy
loaded}' is printed.  The effect of the call may not be written to the
theory file of the segment until  {close_theory} is invoked.  If HOL is
quit before this, the effect may not persist to future HOL sessions.

\FAILURE

Executing {new_abs_parent `thy`} will fail if the system is not in
draft mode. It will fail if {thy} is not a theory on the current search
path. It will fail if there is a type in theory {thy} with the same name
as a type in the current theory. It will fail if there is a constant in
theory {thy} with the same name as a constant in the current theory. It
will fail if an ancestor of theory {thy} has been extended with either
new types or constants which clash with names in theory {thy}. It will
also fail if any of the theory files of theory {thy} have been damaged. On
failure, the system recovers cleanly, unloading any theory segments it had
loaded before the failure was detected.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

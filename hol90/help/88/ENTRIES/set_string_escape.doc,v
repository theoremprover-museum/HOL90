@\DOC set_string_escape

\TYPE {set_string_escape : (int -> int)}

\SYNOPSIS
Changes the escape character inside strings.

\DESCRIBE
{set_string_escape n} changes the escape character in strings to be the
character with ascii code {n}. The previous character code is returned.
Initially the escape is ascii 92 (i.e. `{\}'). If {n} is not an ascii code
then there is no escape character available.

\FAILURE
Never fails (not even if the supplied code is not an ascii code).

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC BEGIN_STACK_TAC

\TYPE {BEGIN_STACK_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Open a subwindow on the current goal of the subgoals package.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {BEGIN_STACK_TAC thms} leaves the current goal unchanged,
but as a side-effect it creates a new window stack called
{"TACTIC STACK"}.  The focus of the top (and only) window of this new
stack is the goal.  The window will have the assumptions of the goal
as it's assumptions.  The window will have {thms} as it's set of
relevant theorems. The relation preserved by the window will be {<==}
so that the window can be used to transform {goal} to {goal'},
generating the theorem {(H |- goal <== goal')}.  When the stack is
ended with {END_STACK_TAC ()} the goal will be transformed from {goal}
to {goal'}.

\FAILURE
{BEGIN_STACK_TAC thms} will fail if the goal stack is empty, or if
these already exists a window stack called {"TACTIC STACK"}.

\EXAMPLE
{
   - set_goal ([], --`A /\ (A = B)`--);
   (--`A /\ (A = B)`--)
   =============================
   
   
   val it = () : unit
   - e (BEGIN_STACK_TAC []);
   OK..
   
   <== * A /\ (A = B)
   1 subgoal:
   (--`A /\ (A = B)`--)
   =============================
   
   
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (OPEN_WIN [RAND]);
   
       ! A
   <== * A = B
   val it = () : unit
      - DO (ASM_REWRITE_WIN []);
   
       ! A
   <== * B
   val it = () : unit
   - DO CLOSE_WIN;
   
   <== * A /\ B
   val it = () : unit
   - e (END_STACK_TAC ());
   OK..
   1 subgoal:
   (--`A /\ B`--)
   =============================
   
   
   val it = () : unit
}

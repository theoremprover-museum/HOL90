\DOC CHECK_ASSUME_TAC

\TYPE {CHECK_ASSUME_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Adds a theorem to the assumption list of goal, unless it solves the goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A' |- s} and a goal {A ?- t}, the tactic
{CHECK_ASSUME_TAC} checks whether the theorem will solve the goal (this
includes the possibility that the theorem is just {A' |- F}). If so, the goal
is duly solved. If not, the theorem is added to the assumptions of the goal,
unless it is already there.
{
       A ?- t
   ==============  CHECK_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- F)   [special case 1]


       A ?- t
   ==============  CHECK_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- t)   [special case 2]


       A ?- t
   ==============  CHECK_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- s)   [general case]
    A u {{s}} ?- t
}
\noindent Unless {A'} is a subset of {A}, the tactic will be invalid, although
it will not fail.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

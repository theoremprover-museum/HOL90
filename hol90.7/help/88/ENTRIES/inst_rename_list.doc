\DOC inst_rename_list

\TYPE {inst_rename_list : (term -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Looks for variables which could become bound after type instantiation.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
  inst_rename_list tm
}
\noindent will return a list of those variables in {tm} which are in the scope
of a binding of a variable with the same name but a different type. This means
that instantiating the type of a variable of that name could lead to free
variable capture.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
The examples needed to exercise this routine cannot be created using a single
quoted term, since the quotation parser assumes that all variables with the
same name are identical.
{
   #let tm = mk_abs("x:num","~x");;
   tm = "\x. ~x" : term

   #inst_rename_list tm;;
   ["x"] : term list

   #type_of (hd it);;
   ":bool" : type
}
\USES
Checking the validity of type instantiations.

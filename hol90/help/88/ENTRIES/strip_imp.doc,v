@\DOC strip_imp

\TYPE {strip_imp : (term -> goal)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively breaks apart implications.

\DESCRIBE
{strip_imp "t1 ==> ( ... (tn ==> t)...)"} returns {(["t1";...;"tn"],"t")}.
Note that
{
   strip_imp(list_mk_imp(["t1";...;"tn"],"t"))
}
\noindent will not return {(["t1";...;"tn"],"t")} if {t} is an implication.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#strip_imp "(T ==> F) ==> (T ==> F)";;
(["T ==> F"; "T"], "F") : goal
}
\SEEALSO
list_mk_imp, dest_imp.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC print_int

\TYPE {print_int : (int -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints an ML integer to the terminal.

\DESCRIBE
{print_int n} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the value
of {n} to the terminal. The text is not terminated with a carriage return.
In fact, the text is queued until the pretty-printer decides where line breaks
are needed, or until the queue is explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_int 2;;
2() : void

#print_int (-10);;
-10() : void
}
\SEEALSO
print_begin, print_end, print_newline.

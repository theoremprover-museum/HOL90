\TYPE {link : ((string # string) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a new link to a file.

\DESCRIBE
If {old} and {new} are filenames, where {old} exists and {new} does not, then
the call
{
   link(`old`,`new`)
}
\noindent will link the name {new} to the file {old} in the manner of the Unix
shell command
{
   ln old new
}
\FAILURE
A call to {link} may fail in various system-related ways, in particular if
{old} does not exist, or is a directory, or {new} already exists.

\EXAMPLE
The following example is assumed to be run under Unix:
{
   #system `touch test-file`;;
   0 : int

   #link(`test-file`,`test-link`);;
   () : void
}
\COMMENTS
This call is somewhat Unix-related, and may not work under other operating
systems.

\SEEALSO
system, unlink.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

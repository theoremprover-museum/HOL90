    * type context
    *
    * Each reducer collects the working context on its own.
    * A context object is the current state of a single reducer.

   (* ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    * Reducers
    *   These are the things that get applied to terms during 
    * traversal.  They prove theorems which state that the 
    * current term reduces to a related 
    *
    * Each reducer manages its own storage of the working context (of one
    * of the forms above - Nb. in SML exceptions are able to contain
    * any kind of data, so contexts can be any appropriate format.  This
    * is a hack, but it is the best way to get good data hiding in SML
    * without resorting to functors)
    *
    * The fields of a reducer are:
    *
    * apply:  This is the reducer itself.  The arguments passed by
    *   the traversal engine to the reduce routine are:
    *    solver: 
    *      A continuation function, to be used if the reducer needs to
    *      solve some side conditions and want to continue traversing
    *      in order to do so.  The continuation invokes traversal
    *      under equality, then calls EQT_ELIM.
    *
    *      At the moment the continuation is primarily designed to 
    *      be used to solve side conditions in context.
    *
    *      Note that this function is *not* the same as 
    *      the congruence side condition solver.
    *
    *    context:
    *      The reducer's current view of the context, as 
    *      collected by its "addcontext" function.
    *    term list:
    *      The current side condition stack, which grows as nested calls
    *      to the solver are made.
    *
    * addcontext: routine is invoked every time more context is added
    *   to the current environment by virtue of congruence routines.
    *
    * initial:  The inital context.
    * ---------------------------------------------------------------------*)
    
  datatype reducer = REDUCER of {
         initial: context,
         addcontext : context * thm list -> context,

		 context: context,
		 stack:term list} -> conv

    * TRAVERSE : {rewriters: reducer list,
    *             dprocs: reducer list,
    *             travrules: travrules,
    *             relation: term}
    *             -> thm list -> conv
    * 
    * Implements a procedure which tries to prove a term is related 
    * to a (simpler) term by the relation given in the travrules.
    * This is done by traversing the term, applying the
    * procedures specified in the travrules at certain subterms.  
    * The traversal strategy is similar to TOP_DEPTH_CONV.
    *
    * The traversal has to be justified by congruence rules.
    * These are also in the travrules.  See "Congprocs" for a more
    * detailed description of congruence rules.
    *
    * In the case of rewriting and simplification, the relation used is  
    * equality (--`$=`--).  However traversal can also be used with
    * other congruences and preorders.
    *
    * The behavious of TRAVERSE depends almost totally on what 
    * is contained in the input travrules.
    *
    * The theorem list is a set of theorems to add initially as context 
    * to the traversal.
    *
    * FAILURE CONDITIONS
    *
    * TRAVERSE never fails, though it may diverge.  Bad congruence rules
    * may cause very strange behaviour.

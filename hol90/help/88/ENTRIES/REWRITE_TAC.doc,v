@\DOC REWRITE_TAC

\TYPE {REWRITE_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal including built-in tautologies in the list of rewrites.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
Rewriting tactics in HOL provide a recursive left-to-right matching
and rewriting facility that automatically decomposes subgoals and
justifies segments of proof in which equational theorems are used,
singly or collectively.  These include the unfolding of definitions,
and the substitution of equals for equals.  Rewriting is used either
to advance or to complete the decomposition of subgoals.

{REWRITE_TAC} transforms (or solves) a goal by using as rewrite rules
(i.e. as left-to-right replacement rules) the conclusions of the given
list of (equational) theorems, as well as a set of built-in theorems
(common tautologies) held in the ML variable {basic_rewrites}.
Recognition of a tautology often terminates the subgoaling process
(i.e. solves the goal).

The equational rewrites generated are applied recursively and to
arbitrary depth, with matching and instantiation of variables and type
variables.  A list of rewrites can set off an infinite rewriting
process, and it is not, of course, decidable in general whether a
rewrite set has that property. The order in which the rewrite theorems
are applied is unspecified, and the user should not depend on any
ordering.

See {GEN_REWRITE_TAC} for more details on the rewriting process.
Variants of {REWRITE_TAC} allow the use of a different set of
rewrites. Some of them, such as {PURE_REWRITE_TAC}, exclude the basic
tautologies from the possible transformations. {ASM_REWRITE_TAC} and
others include the assumptions at the goal in the set of possible
rewrites.

Still other tactics allow greater control over the search for
rewritable subterms. Several of them such as {ONCE_REWRITE_TAC} do not
apply rewrites recursively. {GEN_REWRITE_TAC} allows a rewrite to be
applied at a particular subterm.

\FAILURE
{REWRITE_TAC} does not fail. Certain sets of rewriting theorems on
certain goals may cause a non-terminating sequence of rewrites.
Divergent rewriting behaviour results from a term {t} being
immediately or eventually rewritten to a term containing {t} as a
sub-term. The exact behaviour depends on the {HOL} implementation; it
may be possible (unfortunately) to fall into Lisp in this event.

\EXAMPLE
The arithmetic theorem {GREATER}, {|- !m n. m > n = n < m}, is used
below to advance a goal:
{
   #REWRITE_TAC[GREATER]([],"5 > 4");;
   ([([], "4 < 5")], -) : subgoals
}
\noindent It is used below with the theorem {LESS_0},
{|- !n. 0 < (SUC n)}, to solve a goal:
{
   #let gl,p = REWRITE_TAC[GREATER;LESS_0]([],"(SUC n) > 0");;
   gl = [] : goal list
   p = - : proof

   #p[];;
   |- (SUC n) > 0
}
\USES
Rewriting is a powerful and general mechanism in HOL, and an
important part of many proofs.  It relieves the user of the burden of
directing and justifying a large number of minor proof steps.
{REWRITE_TAC} fits a forward proof sequence smoothly into the general
goal-oriented framework. That is, (within one subgoaling step) it
produces and justifies certain forward inferences, none of which are
necessarily on a direct path to the desired goal.

{REWRITE_TAC} may be more powerful a tactic than is needed in certain
situations; if efficiency is at stake, alternatives might be
considered.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

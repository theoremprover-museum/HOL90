@\DOC CONJUNCTS_THEN

\TYPE {CONJUNCTS_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a theorem-tactic to each conjunct of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{CONJUNCTS_THEN} takes a theorem-tactic {f}, and a theorem {t} whose conclusion
must be a conjunction. {CONJUNCTS_THEN} breaks {t} into two new theorems, {t1}
and {t2} which are {CONJUNCT1} and {CONJUNCT2} of {t} respectively, and then
returns a new tactic: {f t1 THEN f t2}. That is,
{
   CONJUNCTS_THEN f (A |- l /\ r) =  f (A |- l) THEN f (A |- r)
}
\noindent so if
{
   A1 ?- t1                    A2 ?- t2
  ==========  f (A |- l)      ==========  f (A |- r)
   A2 ?- t2                    A3 ?- t3
}
\noindent then
{
    A1 ?- t1
   ==========  CONJUNCTS_THEN f (A |- l /\ r)
    A3 ?- t3
}
\FAILURE
{CONJUNCTS_THEN f} will fail if applied to a theorem whose conclusion is not a
conjunction.

\COMMENTS
{CONJUNCTS_THEN f (A |- u1 /\ ... /\ un)} results in the tactic:
{
   f (A |- u1) THEN f (A |- u2 /\ ... /\ un)
}
\noindent Unfortunately, it is more likely that the user had wanted the tactic:
{
   f (A |- u1) THEN ... THEN f(A |- un)
}
\noindent Such a tactic could be defined as follows:
{
   let CONJUNCTS_THENL (f:thm_tactic) thm =
         itlist $THEN (map f (CONJUNCTS thm)) ALL_TAC;;
}
\noindent or by using {REPEAT_TCL}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

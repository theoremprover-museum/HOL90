\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Instantiates an abstract theorem. 

\DESCRIBE

The call {instantiate_abstract_theorem `thy` `th` tpl val}
instantiates the theorem {th} from the abstract theory {thy} using
the instantiation {tpl} and validation {val}, where {tpl} is a
list of paired terms where the first term is the variable to be
instantiated and the second term is the instantiation and {val} is a
proof that the instantiation meets the theory obligations for the source
abstract theorem. The instantiation works whether the theory obligations
were made implicit or explicit in the original goal.  The resulting theorem
is {\em not} automatically saved in the current theory segment, but must be
explicitly saved using {save_thm}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the instantiation cannot be resolved with the source theorem or
the validation does not match the instantiation.  Fails if the {thy}
is not an ancestor or the {th} is not found in {thy}.

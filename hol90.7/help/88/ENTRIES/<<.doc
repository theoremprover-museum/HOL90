\TYPE {$<< : ((* # **) -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs a lexical comparison of values.

\KEYWORDS
address, order.

\DESCRIBE
{$<<} performs a fast ordering on values.  It is substitutive with
respect to equality in ML (i.e. if {x << y} and {x = x'} and {y = y'}
then {x' << y'}).

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
It is often useful, for example in normalizing terms in some way, to be able to
impose some arbitrary (but definite) ordering on ML values.

@\DOC load_axioms

\TYPE {load_axioms : (string -> void list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in all the axioms from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, then the call
{
   load_axioms `thy`
}
\noindent attempts to load in all the axioms from that theory, that is, for
each axiom {ax}, to perform dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let ax = axiom `thy` `ax`;;
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless {thy} is an ancestor theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_axioms `bool`;;
[(); (); (); (); ()] : void list

SELECT_AX = |- !P x. P x ==> P($@@ P)

ETA_AX = |- !t. (\x. t x) = t

IMP_ANTISYM_AX = |- !t1 t2. (t1 ==> t2) ==> (t2 ==> t1) ==> (t1 = t2)

BOOL_CASES_AX = |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F)

ARB_THM = |- $= = $=
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

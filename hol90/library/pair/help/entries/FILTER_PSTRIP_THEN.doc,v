@\DOC FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN

\TYPE {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN : (thm_tactic -> term -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, selective.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Conditionally strips a goal, handing an antecedent to the theorem-tactic.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem-tactic {ttac}, a term {u} and a goal {(A,t)},
{FILTER_STRIP_THEN ttac u} removes one outer connective ({!}, {==>}, or {~})
from {t}, if the term being stripped does not contain a free instance of {u}.
Note that {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} will strip paired universal quantifiers.
A negation {~t} is treated as the implication {t ==> F}. The theorem-tactic
{ttac} is applied only when stripping an implication, by using the antecedent
stripped off. {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} also breaks conjunctions.

{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} behaves like {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN}, if the term being stripped
does not contain a free instance of {u}. In particular, {FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN
PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC} behaves like {FILTER_PSTRIP_TAC}.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN ttac u (A,t)} fails if {t} is not a paired universally
quantified term, an implication, a negation or a conjunction;
or if the term being stripped contains the term {u} (conjunction excluded);
or if the application of {ttac} fails, after stripping the goal.

\USES
{FILTER_PSTRIP_THEN} is used to manipulate intermediate results
using theorem-tactics, after stripping outer connectives
from a goal in a more delicate way than {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

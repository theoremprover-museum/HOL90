# GUIDE FOR INSTALLING XHOLHELP - BROWSER FOR HOL DOCUMENTATION


# There are two steps in installing xholhelp: the first one is to set up
# paths to shell-scripts and documentation files. The second one is to
# compile the C program.

# STEP 1. Author: Phillip J. Windley, University of Idaho
#
# Change the variables XHOLHELP_PATH and HOL_HELP_PATH in the
# following lines to reflect the location of the xholhelp
# directory and the HOL help directories, respectively.
#
# Note that at a minimum, the folllowing files should live in
# XHOLHELP_PATH: hol_apro, hol_ref, hol_thm, hol_funs, *.sed and
# xhelphelp.help (say in the tools directory.)
#

XHOLHELP_PATH=/usr/wiss/slind/hol/working/tools/Xhelp
HOL88_HELP_PATH=/usr/wiss/slind/hol/working/help/88
HOL90_HELP_PATH=/usr/wiss/slind/hol/working/help/90

# Then run the following script (by executing this file):

for f in xholhelp.h hol_apro hol_ref hol_thm hol_funs
do 
   sed -e "s:ORIG_DIR:$XHOLHELP_PATH:g;\
           s:ORIG_HELP_PATH:$HOL88_HELP_PATH:g;\
           s:HOL90_HELP_PATH:$HOL90_HELP_PATH:g;\
           s:\:/ENTRIES::g;\
           s:\:/THEOREMS/\*::g" $f.orig >$f
   chmod 755 $f
done
chmod 644 xholhelp.h



# STEP2: USING IMAKE

# Imake is a "C preprocessor interface to the make utility".
# This directory contains a file called Imakefile. It is a template
# to create a Makefile. "xmkmf" sets parameters regarding the X
# installation and calls Imake.
# This step is accomplished by executing this file.

xmkmf
make clean
make all



# The script "xmkmf" should exist in most installations running X11
# (and OpenWindows). If you cannot find it consult the local Xpert.

# Also feel free to contact me if you still have problems.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

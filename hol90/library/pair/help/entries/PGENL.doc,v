@\DOC PGENL

\TYPE {PGENL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, universal.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes zero or more pairs in the conclusion of a theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a list of paired variable structures {[p1;...;pn]}
and a theorem {A |- t}, the inference rule {PGENL} returns
the theorem {A |- !p1...pn. t}, provided none of the constituent variables
from any of the pairs {pi} occur free in the assumptions.
{
         A |- t
   ------------------  PGENL "[p1;...;pn]"       [where no pi is free in A]
    A |- !p1...pn. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless all the terms in the list are paired structures of variables,
none of the variables from which are free in the assumption list.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

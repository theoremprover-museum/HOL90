hol90.9 (alpha release)
=======

An alpha release of a new version of hol90 is now available. The main aims of
this release are better portability and inclusion of new tools. It should be
considered to be unstable, so you use it at your own risk. Having said that,
we encourage (experienced) HOL users to try it out. In particular, we would
like it to be tested on a variety of platforms. For this reason, theory files
are not distributed -- they must be built from scratch. Note also that the
contributed libraries are not included and the manual and help files have not
been updated. Ports of the contributed libraries will be gratefully received.


What's new
----------

* ``...`` may be used for term quotations and ``:...`` for type quotations.
  The old-style quotations (--`...`--) and (==`:...`==) are still allowed.

* hol90.9 builds with Standard ML of New Jersey 0.93, SML/NJ 109, and
  Poly/ML 3.0. Earlier versions of Poly/ML may also work. The Poly/ML port is
  a bit rough, e.g. the indentation in pretty-printing does not work properly
  and types are often printed with full structure paths. The portability has
  been implemented by Elsa Gunter, Donald Syme and Richard Boulton.

* A conditional/contextual simplifier by Donald Syme.

* Higher order rewriting and matching due to John Harrison and ported by
  Donald Syme. It does not implement full higher order matching. The matching
  is deterministic.

* Well founded function definitions due to Konrad Slind.

* A new inductive definitions package based on well founded recursion.
  Written by John Harrison and ported by Donald Syme.

* MESON model elimination and tableau-based first order theorem provers.
  Written by John Harrison and ported by Donald Syme.

* Co-operating decision procedures for quantifier-free formulas built up from
  linear natural number arithmetic, propositional logic, and the equational
  theories of pairs, recursive types, and uninterpreted function symbols.
  Written by Richard Boulton.


How to get it
-------------

The sources are available at the following URLs:

Cambridge (UK)    http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/ftp/hvg/hol90/hol90.9.alpha.tar.gz
Bell Labs (USA)   ftp://research.att.com/dist/ml/hol90/hol90.9.alpha.tar.gz

The file can be unpacked using the command:

   gzcat hol90.9.alpha.tar.gz | tar xf -

See the file doc/install.html in the directory created for further
instructions. Note that the way hol90 is built has changed substantially from
earlier versions.

  Donald Syme. This does not implement full higher order matching but the
  matching is deterministic. This tool may be used when higher order matching
  is required but the full power of the conditional/contextual simplifier is
  not. For interactive use, one should normally use the simplifier instead.

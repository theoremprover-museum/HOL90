\DOC GQSPECL

\TYPE {GQSPECL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes zero or more variables in the conclusion of a 
universally quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term list {[u1;...;un]} and a theorem whose conclusion has
zero or more ordinary or restricted universal quantifications,
the inference rule {GQSPECL} returns a theorem which is the result of
specializing the quantified variables. The substitutions are made
sequentially left-to-right in the same way as for {GQSPEC}, with the same
sort of alpha-conversions applied to the body of the conclusion.
The two kinds of universal quantification can be mixed.
{
       A |- !x1::P1. ... !xk. ... !xn::Pn. t
   --------------------------------------------------  GQSPECL "[u1;...;un]"
    A,P1 u1,...,Pn un |- t[u1/x1]...[uk/xk]...[un/xn]
}
\noindent It is permissible for the term-list to be empty, in which case
the application of {GQSPECL} has no effect.

\FAILURE
Fails if one of the specialization of the 
quantified variable in the original theorem fails.

@\DOC PEXISTS_EQ

\TYPE {PEXISTS_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, quantifier, existential, equality.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Existentially quantifies both sides of an equational theorem.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a paired structure of variables {p} and a theorem
whose conclusion is equational:
{
    A |- t1 = t2
}
the inference rule {PEXISTS_EQ} returns the theorem:
{
    A |- (?p. t1) = (?p. t2)
}
provided the none of the variables in {p} is not free in any of the
assumptions.
{
          A |- t1 = t2
   --------------------------  PEXISTS_EQ "p"      [where p is not free in A]
    A |- (?p. t1) = (?p. t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational with both sides having type {bool},
or if the term is not a paired structure of variables, or if any variable in
the pair to be quantified over is free in any of the assumptions.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

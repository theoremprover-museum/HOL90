@\DOC EVERY_CONV

\TYPE {EVERY_CONV : (conv list -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies in sequence all the conversions in a given list of conversions.

\KEYWORDS
conversional.

\DESCRIBE
{EVERY_CONV [c1;...;cn] "t"} returns the result of applying the conversions
{c1}, ..., {cn} in sequence to the term {"t"}. The conversions are applied in
the order in which they are given in the list. In particular, if {ci "ti"}
returns {|- ti=ti+1} for {i} from {1} to {n}, then
{EVERY_CONV [c1;...;cn] "t1"} returns {|- t1=t(n+1)}.  If the supplied list of
conversions is empty, then {EVERY_CONV} returns the identity conversion.  That
is, {EVERY_CONV [] "t"} returns {|- t=t}.

\FAILURE
{EVERY_CONV [c1;...;cn] "t"} fails if any one of the conversions {c1}, ...,
{cn} fails when applied in sequence as specified above.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

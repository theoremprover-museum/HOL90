\DOC preterm_const

\TYPE {preterm_const : (string -> preterm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructs constant preterm.

\DESCRIBE
{preterm_const} is analogous to the oft-used ML function {mk_var}.  Since,
however, preterms are untypechecked terms, the restrictions imposed when
using {mk_const} (i.e. that the constant must be either implicitly or
explicitly associated with a specific type) are not encountered until the
preterm is typechecked.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#preterm_const `T`;;
preterm_const `T` : preterm

#preterm_to_term it;;
"T" : term

#type_of it;;
":bool" : type
}

\TYPE {CS : (searchstep -> searchstep)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to continue a search. Abbreviation for {continue_search}.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
A search can be continued using the function {CS}. It takes a step of a search
as argument, and performs the next step of the search. The steps correspond to
searches of individual theory segments.

\FAILURE
Fails if the step given as argument is a final step. The function may fail for
other reasons. Since the user may supply his/her own side-condition functions
at the beginning of the search, an exhaustive list of possible failures cannot
be given.

\SEEALSO

search_until_find, search_n_theories, search_n_until_find.

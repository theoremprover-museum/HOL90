\TYPE {Compat.last : 'a list -> 'a}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the last element of a list.

\DESCRIBE
{last [x1,...,xn]} returns {xn}.

\FAILURE
Found in the hol88 library. Fails with {last} if the list is empty. It
will not be found unless the hol88 library has been loaded.

\COMMENTS
Not in hol90, since it was never used in the implementation.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC load_definition

\TYPE {load_definition : (string -> string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in a given definition from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, and {def} one of its definitions,
then
{
   load_definition `thy` `def`
}
\noindent attempts to load the corresponding definition, that is, to perform
dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let def = definition `thy` `def`;;
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {thy} is not an ancestor theory, or if {def} is not one of its
definitions.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_definition `bool` `FORALL_DEF`;;
() : void

FORALL_DEF = |- $! = (\P. P = (\x. T))

#FORALL_DEF;;
|- $! = (\P. P = (\x. T))
}
\USES
Useful for autoloading.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

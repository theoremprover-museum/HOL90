@\DOC GQSPEC_ALL

\TYPE {GQSPEC_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with its own quantified variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem whose conclusion has zero or more 
ordinary or restricted universal quantifications,
the inference rule {GQSPEC_ALL} returns a theorem which is the result
of specializing the quantified variables with its own variables. If this
will cause name clashes, a variant of the variable is used instead.
Normally {xi'} is just {xi}, in which case {GQSPEC_ALL} simply removes
all universal quantifiers.

Never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

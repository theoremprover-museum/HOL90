@\DOC loadt

\TYPE {loadt : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
{loadt} loads an ML file with the verbose flag set to {true}.

\DESCRIBE
The function {loadt} takes a string indicating the ML file name as
argument and loads it in the same manner as {load}, except that the
verbose flag is always set to {true}.

\FAILURE
{loadt} will fail if the file named by the argument does not exist in
the search path. It will fail in the same manner if the file is not a
valid ML file. Failure in the ML file will also terminate loading.

\EXAMPLE
If we have an ML file called {foo.ml} which contains the line
{
   let x=2+2;;
}
\noindent this can be loaded as follows:
{
   #loadt `foo.ml`;;
}
\noindent and the system would respond with:
{
   x = 4 : int

   File foo.ml loaded
   () : void
}
\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

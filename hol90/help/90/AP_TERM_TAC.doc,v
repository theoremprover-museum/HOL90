@\DOC AP_TERM_TAC

\TYPE {AP_TERM_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips a function application from both sides of an equational goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{AP_TERM_TAC} reduces a goal of the form {A ?- f x = f y} by stripping away
the function applications, giving the new goal {A ?- x = y}.
{
    A ?- f x = f y
   ================  AP_TERM_TAC
     A ?- x = y
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal is equational, with both sides being applications
of the same function.

\SEEALSO
AP_TERM, AP_THM.

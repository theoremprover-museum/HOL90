@\DOC REDUCE_CONV

\TYPE {REDUCE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs arithmetic or boolean reduction at all levels possible.

\LIBRARY reduce

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {REDUCE_CONV} attempts to apply, in bottom-up order to all
suitable redexes, one of the following conversions from the {reduce} library
(only one can succeed):
{
   ADD_CONV  AND_CONV  BEQ_CONV  COND_CONV
   DIV_CONV  EXP_CONV   GE_CONV    GT_CONV
   IMP_CONV   LE_CONV   LT_CONV   MOD_CONV
   MUL_CONV  NEQ_CONV  NOT_CONV    OR_CONV
   PRE_CONV  SBC_CONV  SUC_CONV
}
\noindent In particular, it will prove the appropriate reduction for an
arbitrarily complicated expression constructed from numerals and the boolean
constants {T} and {F}.

\FAILURE
Never fails, but may give a reflexive equation.

\EXAMPLE
{
#REDUCE_CONV "(2=3) = F";;
|- ((2 = 3) = F) = T

#REDUCE_CONV "(100 < 200) => (2 EXP (8 DIV 2)) | (3 EXP ((26 EXP 0) * 3))";;
|- (100 < 200 => 2 EXP (8 DIV 2) | 3 EXP ((26 EXP 0) * 3)) = 16

#REDUCE_CONV "(15 = 16) \/ (15 < 16)";;
|- (15 = 16) \/ 15 < 16 = T

#REDUCE_CONV "0 + x";;
|- 0 + x = 0 + x
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC GSPEC

\TYPE {GSPEC : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with unique variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, genvars.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x1...xn. t}, where the number of universally
quantified variables may be zero, {GSPEC} returns {A |- t[g1/x1]...[gn/xn]},
where the {gi} are distinct variable names of the appropriate type, chosen by
{genvar}.
{
        A |- !x1...xn. t
   -------------------------  GSPEC
    A |- t[g1/x1]...[gn/xn]
}
\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
{GSPEC} is useful in writing derived inference rules which need to specialize
theorems while avoiding using any variables that may be present elsewhere.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC GQSPEC_ALL

\TYPE {GQSPEC_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with its own quantified variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem whose conclusion has zero or more 
ordinary or restricted universal quantifications,
the inference rule {GQSPEC_ALL} returns a theorem which is the result
of specializing the quantified variables with its own variables. If this
will cause name clashes, a variant of the variable is used instead.
Normally {xi'} is just {xi}, in which case {GQSPEC_ALL} simply removes
all universal quantifiers.

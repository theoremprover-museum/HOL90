@\DOC CHANGED_CONV

\TYPE {CHANGED_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a conversion fail if applying it leaves a term unchanged.

\KEYWORDS
conversional.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion that maps a term {"t"} to a theorem {|- t = t'}, where
{t'} is alpha-equivalent to {t}, then {CHANGED_CONV c} is a conversion that
fails when applied to the term {"t"}. If {c} maps {"t"} to {|- t = t'}, where
{t'} is not alpha-equivalent to {t}, then {CHANGED_CONV c} also maps {"t"} to
{|- t = t'}. That is, {CHANGED_CONV c} is the conversion that behaves exactly
like {c}, except that it fails whenever the conversion {c} would leave its
input term unchanged (up to alpha-equivalence).

\FAILURE
{CHANGED_CONV c "t"} fails if {c} maps {"t"} to {|- t = t'}, where {t'} is
alpha-equivalent to {t}, or if {c} fails when applied to {"t"}.  The function
returned by {CHANGED_CONV c} may also fail if the ML function {c:term->thm} is
not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps a term {t} to a theorem
{|- t = t'}).

\USES
{CHANGED_CONV} is used to transform a conversion that may leave terms
unchanged, and therefore may cause a nonterminating computation if repeated,
into one that can safely be repeated until application of it fails to
substantially modify its input term.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

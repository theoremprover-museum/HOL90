\TYPE {define_finite_set_syntax : ((string # string) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets up an interpretation of finite set syntax.

\DESCRIBE
The HOL quotation parser supports the notation {"{{x1,...,xn}}"}. This is
primarily intended to support the {sets} library and dependent work,
meaning `the set consisting just of the elements {x1...xn}', but
this function allows the interpretation of the notation to be changed. A call
{
   define_finite_set_syntax(`base`,`cons`)
}
\noindent causes
{
   "{{x1,x2,...,xn}}"
}
\noindent to be parsed as
{
   "cons x1 (cons x2 (cons ... (cons xn base) ... ))"
}
\noindent where {base} and {cons} should be the names of constants, the former
of which may be an infix. The printer will invert this transformation.

\FAILURE
Fails unless both argument strings are the names of constants of the current
theory.

\EXAMPLE
We can use set notation for special boolean lists as follows
{
   #new_theory `snork`;;
   () : void

   #new_definition(`cons`,"cons (x:bool) (l:bool list) = CONS x l");;
   |- !x l. cons x l = CONS x l

   #new_definition(`nil`,"nil = ([]:bool list)");;
   |- nil = []

   #define_finite_set_syntax(`nil`,`cons`);;
   () : void

   #"{{F,T,T}}";;
   "{{F,T,T}}" : term

   #it = "cons F (cons T (cons T nil))";;
   true : bool
}

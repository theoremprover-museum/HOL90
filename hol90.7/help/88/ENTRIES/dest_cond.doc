\DOC dest_cond

\TYPE {dest_cond : (term -> (term # term # term))}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart a conditional into the three terms involved.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_cond} is a term destructor for conditionals:
{
   dest_cond "t => t1 | t2"
}
\noindent returns {("t","t1","t2")}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {dest_cond} if term is not a conditional.

\COMMENTS
Since {COND}, which underlies the surface syntax, can be polymorphic,
performing a similar operation using {dest_comb} and {dest_const} would be
rather tedious.

\SEEALSO
mk_cond, is_cond.

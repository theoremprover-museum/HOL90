\KEYWORDS
conversion, word.

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the predicate asserting the size of a word.

\DESCRIBE
For a term {tm} of type {:(bool)word} involving only a combination of bitwise
operators {WNOT}, {WAND}, {WOR}, {WXOR} and variables, the
result of evaluating 
{
   PWORDLEN_bitop_CONV  "PWORDLEN n tm"
}
\noindent is the theorem
{
   ..., PWORDLEN n vi, ... |- PWORDLEN n tm = T
}
\noindent Each free variable occurred in {tm} will have a corresponding
clause in the assumption. This conversion recursively descends into
the subterms of {tm} until it reaches all simple variables.

\FAILURE
{PWORDLEN_bitop_CONV tm} fails if constants other than those mentioned
above occur in {tm}.

\TYPE {ISPECL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes a theorem zero or more times, with type instantiation if necessary.

\KEYWORDS
rule, type.

\DESCRIBE
{ISPECL} is an iterative version of {ISPEC}
{
         A |- !x1...xn.t
   ----------------------------  ISPECL ["t1",...,"tn"]
    A |- t[t1,...tn/x1,...,xn]
}
\noindent (where {ti} is free for {xi} in {tm}).

\FAILURE
{ISPECL} fails if the list of terms is longer than the number of
quantified variables in the term, if the type instantiation fails, or
if the type variable being instantiated is free in the assumptions.

\SEEALSO
INST_TYPE, INST_TY_TERM, ISPEC, MATCH, SPEC, SPECL.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

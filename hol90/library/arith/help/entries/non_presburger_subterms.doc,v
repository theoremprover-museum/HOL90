@Support for the predecessor function, PRE, has been added to the arith
library. It is eliminated in the pre-processing phase along with natural
number subtraction. The modifications are due to Kim Dam Petersen of
Tele Danmark Research.

R.J.Boulton, 16th November 1995.

\TYPE {non_presburger_subterms : (term -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Computes the subterms of a term that are not in the Presburger subset of
arithmetic.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
This function computes a list of subterms of a term that are not in the
Presburger subset of natural number arithmetic. All numeric variables in the
term are included in the result. Presburger natural arithmetic is the subset
of arithmetic formulae made up from natural number constants, numeric
variables, addition, multiplication by a constant, the natural number
relations {<}, {<=}, {=}, {>=}, {>} and the logical connectives {~}, {/\},
{\/}, {==>}, {=} (if-and-only-if), {!} (`forall') and {?} (`there exists').

Products of two expressions which both contain variables are not included in
the subset, so such products will appear in the result list. However, the
function {SUC} which is not normally included in a specification of Presburger
arithmetic is allowed in this HOL implementation. This function also considers
subtraction and the predecessor function, {PRE}, to be part of the subset.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#non_presburger_subterms "!m n p. m < (2 * n) /\ (n + n) <= p ==> m < SUC p";;
["m"; "n"; "p"] : term list

#non_presburger_subterms "!m n p q. m < (n * p) /\ (n * p) < q ==> m < q";;
["m"; "n * p"; "q"] : term list

#non_presburger_subterms "(m + n) - m = f n";;
["m"; "n"; "f n"] : term list
}

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

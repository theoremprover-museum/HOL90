@\DOC get_state

\TYPE {get_state : (void -> goalstack)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the current proof state of the subgoal package.

\DESCRIBE
The function {get_state} is part of the subgoal package. It returns the current
proof state. A proof state of the package consists of either  goal and
justification stacks if a proof is in progress or a theorem if a proof has just
been completed. For a description of the subgoal package, see {set_goal}.

\USES
Providing additional backup. Pausing in the proof of a goal whilst lemmas
required for its completion are proved. {get_state} is used in conjunction with
{set_state}. The current state may be bound to an ML variable using {get_state}
and later restored using {set_state}.

\EXAMPLE
In this example, a proof state is bound to the ML variable {main_proof}.
{
   #g "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])";;
   "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

   () : void

   #let main_proof = get_state();;
   main_proof = - : goalstack
}
\noindent Other goals may now be set and proved. The proof state may later be
restored using {set_state} and the original proof continued.
{
   #set_state main_proof;;
   "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

   () : void
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

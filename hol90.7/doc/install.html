If it happens that you want to move the system after it has been built,
consult <A HREF = "#Moving hol90 after it has been built"> Moving hol90
after it has been built</A>.  If you have any trouble building the
system, please send mail to 
<PRE>
    slind@informatik.tu-muenchen.de
</PRE>

<STRONG>Important!</STRONG> Once you have installed the system, all users 
must rebuild any theories (and libraries that build theories) that have 
been built on an earlier release of hol90.

Currently, hol90 is being implemented in the SML/NJ dialect of SML. It
has some dependencies on that compiler, although ports to PolyML and
other compilers have been successfully carried out in the past. For now,
though, the New Jersey compiler is what you need. The New Jersey
compiler has a well-deserved reputation for being memory hungry. You can
run hol90 on a 16 Megabyte Sun workstation, but the more memory the
better! A workstation with 24 Megabytes or more, with generous swap
space is recommended. The current public release of the SML/NJ compiler
is available from
<A HREF = "ftp://ftp.research.att.com/dist/ml/">Bell Labs</A>.

For this release, we assume that theory files will be represented in
ascii on disk. Currently this is preferable because ascii theories are
architecture independent and orders of magnitude smaller than binary
theories. If you have an intense desire to build binary theory files, 
send mail to the author of this document.

The model for building the hol90 system is simply to make the system
image for every architecture of interest. In the following <VAR>sml</VAR>
is a copy of the SML/NJ compiler (with perhaps some other functions
added, e.g., the SML/NJ library). The notation <VAR>.../hol90</VAR>
represents the full path to the hol90 sources.
<P>
In the simplest case, making the system image for an architecture is
done by invoking the unix command
<PRE>
    make_hol <VAR>sml</VAR>
</PRE>
in the directory <VAR>.../hol90/src</VAR>. This will leave an image
<KBD>hol90.</KBD><VAR>arch</VAR>, where <VAR>arch</VAR> is what SML/NJ 
thinks is the machine architecture. It takes about 20 minutes on a SPARC10, 
and considerably longer for some other machines.
<P>
There are extra options to <KBD>make_hol</KBD> that cover special
circumstances, so if you find that the default option to <KBD>make_hol</KBD>
doesn't give you the flexibility you need to build hol90 at your
site, the following documentation gives more detail.


<H2>make_hol</H2>

The calling convention for <KBD>make_hol</KBD> is:
<PRE>
    <KBD>make_hol</KBD> <VAR>sml</VAR> [-n | -b | -o] [-d <VAR>path</VAR>]
</PRE>
The default, calling <KBD>make_hol</KBD> <VAR>sml</VAR> with no parameters, 
tells the system to
<UL>
<LI> Re-use the existing (ascii) theory files. These will be the theory
     files that were shipped with the release, unless the system has
     since been remade locally by invoking <KBD>make_hol</KBD> with the
     <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option.

<LI> Set the hol90 root directory to be the parent directory of the
     current working directory (which is found by <KBD>pwd</KBD>). 
     If <KBD>make_hol</KBD> isn't invoked in <VAR>.../hol90/src</VAR>
     or if one wants the hol90 root directory to be expandable in
     different ways on different machines in a networked computing
     environment, the <STRONG>-d</STRONG> option must be used. 
</UL>

The other options are
<DL>
<DT> -o
<DD> Reuse the existing ascii theory files.
<P>
<DT> -n

<DD> This option tells the system to rebuild all its theories. Be
    warned that a consequence of this option is that the system
    libraries will have to be rebuilt (with <KBD>src/make_lib</KBD>) 
    and all user theories at the site will have to be rebuilt, along with 
    any images that depend on hol90 libraries.
<P>
<DT> -b

<DD>The <STRONG>-b</STRONG> option tells the system to build binary
    theories. This is not advised, and some editing of the 
    <KBD>src/sys01.sml</KBD> file is necessary to get this approach to work.
<P>
<DT> -d <VAR>path</VAR>

<DD> This option to <KBD>make_hol</KBD> is used to establish the root
directory for hol90. If your current directory at the time of calling
<KBD>make_hol</KBD> is not <VAR>.../hol90/src</VAR>, then you will need to
supply the full directory path to the hol90 directory. This option is
also useful in the case when building a version of the system that will
be used in a networked environment, where the root directory may be
expanded differently for different machines in the network. 
<STRONG>Note:</STRONG> there must be a space separating <STRONG>-d</STRONG> and
<VAR>path</VAR>.
</DL>

The default invocation for building the system is equivalent to invoking
<PRE>
    <KBD>make_hol</KBD> <VAR>sml</VAR> -o -d `pwd`/..
</PRE>
in <VAR>.../hol90/src</VAR>.

<H3>Notes</H3>

<UL>
<LI> In the normal course of events, the system needn't be built with the
   <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option. 

<LI> The default and the <STRONG>-n</STRONG> and <STRONG>-o</STRONG> 
     options entail that theory files will be in ascii. This is preferable,
     since ascii files are portable between architectures and are much 
     smaller than binary theory files.
</UL>

<H2>Libraries</H2>

Please note that in this release the system libraries do not
have to be built; that has already been done for you. However, if one
rebuilds the system with the <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option, then libraries
must be rebuilt.  This is done with <KBD>src/make_lib</KBD>; the invocation is
<PRE>
    make_lib <VAR>hol90</VAR>
</PRE>


<H2>Contrib</H2>

In this release the contributed libraries <STRONG>do</STRONG> have to be
built after hol90 has been made (if you want to use a contrib
library). This is done with <KBD>src/make_contrib</KBD>; the invocation
is

<PRE>
    make_contrib <VAR>hol90</VAR>
</PRE>
 
<STRONG>Notes.</STRONG> 

<UL> <LI>Some contrib libraries, <KBD>hol_ML</KBD> in particular, can
take several hours to build, even on a large machine, so you might want
to leave them out of an initial build sequence. In fact, all theories
belonging to contrib libraries have already been made, so the only
installation work that really needs to be done is to re-declare the
contrib library of interest, and put the declaration in the right
place. For example, the <KBD>hol_ML</KBD> library gets built with the
following shell script:

<PRE>
    #!/bin/sh
    
    # Make script for holML library
    
    # Build the theories
    
    
    $* < theories/src/more_list/mk_more_list.sml
    $* < theories/src/more_string/mk_more_string.sml
    $* < theories/src/finmap/mk_finmap.sml
    $* < theories/src/Core/Common/mk_common_holML_core.sml
    $* < theories/src/Core/Plain_Core/mk_holML_Plain_Core.sml
    $* < theories/src/Core/Determinacy/mk_core_determinacy.sml
    $* < theories/src/Modules/Common/mk_common_ModML.sml
    $* < theories/src/Modules/ModML/mk_ModML.sml
    $* < theories/src/Modules/HOFML/mk_HOFML.sml
    
    # Install the library description file
    
    $* < theories/src/mk_holML_lib.sml
    mv holML.hol_lib ../desc
</PRE>

Only the last two lines would need to be executed to install this
library. <EM>i.e.</EM>,

<PRE>
    $* < theories/src/mk_holML_lib.sml
    mv holML.hol_lib ../desc
</PRE>

<LI>
If one moves the hol90 root directory after building the system,
<KBD>contrib</KBD> libraries will be findable (via
<KBD>find_library</KBD>) but not loadable. See <A HREF = "#Moving hol90
after it has been built"> Moving hol90 after it has been built</A> for
more information.

The hol90 manual is hyperlinked, and is mostly self-contained. However,
it does provide links to the local SML/NJ installation, in the file <A
HREF = "sml.html"><KBD>doc/sml.html</KBD></A>. The paths in this file
should be adjusted to the paths for your local setup.

<H1><A NAME = "Moving hol90 after it has been built">
               Moving hol90 after it has been built</A></H1>


One may decide to move hol90 after it has been built. There are a couple
of scenarios that have been considered by the hol90 implementors:

<UL>

<LI> You move only the executables, or link to them. Nothing needs to
   be done: executables can be moved with impunity.

<LI> You move the <VAR>hol90</VAR> directory. For instance, you might have 
  built the system in your home directory, and now want to move the sources to
   <KBD>/usr/local/lib</KBD> and <KBD>hol90.</KBD><VAR>arch</VAR> to 
   <KBD>/usr/local/bin</KBD>. In such a case, you
   have to reset some internal paths in the 
   <KBD>hol90.</KBD><VAR>arch</VAR> images.
   Fortunately, this has been automated. In the following, let 
   <VAR>path</VAR>
   be the full path to the directory you have moved the sources to. (For
   example, if you perform <KBD>mv hol90 /usr/local/lib</KBD> then 
   <VAR>path</VAR>
   is
   <KBD>/usr/local/lib/hol90</KBD>.) On each architecture <VAR>arch</VAR> 
   invoke the following
<PRE>
   tools/resituate_hol90 <VAR>from-image</VAR>  <VAR>to-image</VAR>  <VAR>path</VAR>
</PRE>
   where <VAR>from-image</VAR> is <KBD>hol90.</KBD><VAR>arch</VAR>,
   <VAR>to-image</VAR> is the file name to
   put the saved image at, and  <VAR>path</VAR> is the path to the hol90 root
   directory. For example, on a sun4 one could do, in directory hol90,
   <PRE>
   tools/resituate_hol90 src/hol90.sparc src/hol90.sparc `pwd`
   </PRE>
   Note that this particular invocation will overwrite the file of an
   executing process (namely <KBD>src/hol90.sparc</KBD>). Some operating
   systems may not allow this (how will you know? Don't worry - the OS
   will let you know!); in that case one needs to use a "temporary" 
   <VAR>to-image</VAR>. Invoking 
   something like
   <PRE>
   tools/resituate_hol90 src/hol90.sparc src/hol90.tmp `pwd`
   mv src/hol90.tmp src/hol90.sparc
   </PRE>
   ought to work. After the images have been resituated, one can make 
   symbolic links in <KBD>/usr/local/bin</KBD> to the executables.
<P>
   <KBD>contrib</KBD> libraries will no longer load, although they 
   are findable with <KBD>find_library</KBD>. Probably the simplest solution 
   to this is to not execute <KBD>make_contrib</KBD> until the system 
   is in its final resting place. Otherwise, one can 
  <UL>
  <LI> redo the <KBD>make_contrib</KBD>, or
  <LI> perform a <KBD>find_library</KBD> then <KBD>move_library</KBD>
       everytime one wants a <KBD>contrib</KBD> library, or 
  <LI> edit the <KBD>path</KBD> field in each <KBD>.hol_lib</KBD> 
       file in <KBD>contrib/desc</KBD>.
  </UL>
</UL>
<P>

Finally, once this new version of hol90 has been installed, we repeat
that all hol90 users must rebuild any of their theories that have been
built on an earlier release of hol90.

@\DOC RESQ_SPECL

\TYPE {RESQ_SPECL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes zero or more variables in the conclusion of a restricted
universally quantified theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term list {[u1;...;un]} and a theorem
{A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t}, the inference rule {RESQ_SPECL} returns
the theorem
{
   A,P1 u1,...,Pn un |- t[u1/x1]...[un/xn]
}
\noindent where the substitutions are made
sequentially left-to-right in the same way as for {RESQ_SPEC}, with the same
sort of alpha-conversions applied to {t} if necessary to ensure that no
variables which are free in {ui} become bound after substitution.
{
           A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t
   --------------------------------------------  RESQ_SPECL "[u1;...;un]"
     A,P1 u1, ..., Pn un |- t[u1/x1]...[un/xn]
}
\noindent It is permissible for the term-list to be empty, in which case
the application of {RESQ_SPECL} has no effect.

\FAILURE
Fails if one of the specialization of the 
restricted universally quantified variable in the original theorem fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

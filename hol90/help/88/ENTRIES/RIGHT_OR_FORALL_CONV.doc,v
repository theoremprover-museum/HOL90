@\DOC RIGHT_OR_FORALL_CONV

\TYPE {RIGHT_OR_FORALL_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a universal quantification of the right disjunct outwards through a
disjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, disjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {P \/ (!x.Q)}, the conversion
{RIGHT_OR_FORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- P \/ (!x.Q) = (!x'. P \/ (Q[x'/x]))
}
\noindent where {x'} is a primed variant of {x} that does not appear free in
the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {P \/ (!x.Q)}.

\SEEALSO
OR_FORALL_CONV, FORALL_OR_CONV, LEFT_OR_FORALL_CONV.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

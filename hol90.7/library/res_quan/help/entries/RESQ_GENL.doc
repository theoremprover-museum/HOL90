\DOC RESQ_GENL

\TYPE {RESQ_GENL : ((term # term) list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes zero or more variables to restricted universal quantification
in the conclusion of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term-pair list {[(x1,P1);...;(xn,Pn)]} and a theorem 
{A |- t}, the inference rule {RESQ_GENL} returns the theorem 
{A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t}, provided none of the
variables {xi} are free in any of the assumptions except in the corresponding
{Pi}. It is not necessary that any or all of the {xi} should be free in {t}.

         A |- t
   ------------------------------  RESQ_GENL "[(x1,P1);...;(xn,Pn)]" 
    A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t   [where no xi is free in A except in Pi]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless all the terms {xi} in the list are variables, none of which are
free in the assumption list except in {Pi}.

\DOC EQ_MP

\TYPE {EQ_MP : (thm -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Equality version of the Modus Ponens rule.

\KEYWORDS
rule, equality, modus, ponens.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to theorems {A1 |- t1 = t2} and {A2 |- t1}, the inference
rule {EQ_MP} returns the theorem {A1 u A2 |- t2}.
{
    A1 |- t1 = t2   A2 |- t1
   --------------------------  EQ_MP
         A1 u A2 |- t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the first theorem is equational and its left side
is the same as the conclusion of the second theorem (and is therefore
of type {bool}), up to alpha-conversion.

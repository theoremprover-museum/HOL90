\TYPE {RIGHT_IMP_PFORALL_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, implication.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired universal quantification of the consequent outwards through an
implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {t ==> (!p. u)}, the conversion
{RIGHT_IMP_FORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- t ==> (!p. u) = (!p'. t ==> (u[p'/p]))
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant of the pair {p} that does not
contain any variables that appear free in the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {t ==> (!p. u)}.

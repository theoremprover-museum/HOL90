\DESCRIBE
Before the window inference system can be used to preserve a given
relation, the system must know that the relation is reflexive and
transitive. Initially the system knows about the reflexivity and
transitivity of equality, implication and backward implication. To
inform the system of the reflexivity and transitivity of some new
relation, {NEW}, the user should first prove to new theorems
{NEW_REFL_THM} and {NEW_TRANS_THM}. These theorems should have a form
analogous to that of {IMP_REFL_THM} and {IMP_TRANS_THM} respectively.
The user should then execute the following command:

\noindent{add_relation (NEW_REFL_THM,NEW_TRANS_THM)}.

\FAILURE
{add_relation} will fail if the theorems suplied are not of the
correct form.

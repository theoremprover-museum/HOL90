\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the result of accessing a bit in a word.

\DESCRIBE
For any word of the form {WORD[b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0]}, the result of evaluating
{
   BIT_CONV "BIT k (WORD [b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0])"
}
\noindent is the theorem
{
   |- BIT k (WORD [b(n-1);...;bk;...;b0]) = bk
}
\noindent The bits are indexed form the end of the list and starts
from 0.

\FAILURE
{BIT_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form {"BIT k w"} where {w}
is as described above, or {k} is not less than the size of the word.

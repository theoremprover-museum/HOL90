@\DOC PABS_CONV

\TYPE {PABS_CONV : (conv -> conv)}

\KEYWORDS
conversional, abstraction.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a conversion to the body of a paired abstraction.

\DESCRIBE
If {c} is a conversion that maps a term {"t"} to the theorem {|- t = t'}, then
the conversion {PABS_CONV c} maps abstractions of the form {"\p.t"} to theorems
of the form:
{
   |- (\p.t) = (\p.t')
}
\noindent That is, {ABS_CONV c "\p.t"} applies {p} to the body of the paired
abstraction {"\p.t"}.

\FAILURE
{PABS_CONV c tm} fails if {tm} is not a paired abstraction or if {tm} has the
form {"\p.t"} but the conversion {c} fails when applied to the term {t}.
The function returned by {ABS_CONV p} may also fail if the ML function
{c:term->thm} is not, in fact, a conversion (i.e. a function that maps a term
{t} to a theorem {|- t = t'}).

\EXAMPLE
{
#PABS_CONV SYM_CONV "\(x,y). (1,2) = (x,y)";;
|- (\(x,y). 1,2 = x,y) = (\(x,y). x,y = 1,2)
}
\SEEALSO

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

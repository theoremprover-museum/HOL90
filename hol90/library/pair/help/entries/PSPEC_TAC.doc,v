@\DOC PSPEC_TAC

\TYPE {PSPEC_TAC : ((term # term) -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes a goal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {(q,p)}, where {p} is a paired structure of
variables and a goal {A ?- t}, the tactic {PSPEC_TAC} generalizes the
goal to {A ?- !p. t[p/q]}, that is, all components of {q} are turned into 
the corresponding components of {p}.
{
        A ?- t
   =================  PSPEC_TAC ("q","p")
    A ?- !x. t[p/q]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless {p} is a paired structure of variables with the same type as {q}.

\EXAMPLE
{
g "1 + 2 = 2 + 1";;
"1 + 2 = 2 + 1"

() : void

#e (PSPEC_TAC ("(1,2)","(x:num,y:num)"));;
OK..
"!(x,y). x + y = y + x"

() : void
}

\USES
Removing unnecessary speciality in a goal, particularly as a prelude to
an inductive proof.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

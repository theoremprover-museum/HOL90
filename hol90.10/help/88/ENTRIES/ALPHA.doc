\DOC ALPHA

\TYPE {ALPHA : (term -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of alpha-equivalent terms.

\KEYWORDS
rule, alpha.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {t1} and {t1'} which are
alpha-equivalent, {ALPHA} returns the theorem {|- t1 = t1'}.
{

   -------------  ALPHA "t1" "t1'"
    |- t1 = t1'
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the terms provided are alpha-equivalent.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ALPHA "!x:num. x = x" "!y:num. y = y";;
|- (!x. x = x) = (!y. y = y)
}
\COMMENTS
The system shows the type of {ALPHA} as {term -> conv}.

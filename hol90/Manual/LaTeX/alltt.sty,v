@% ALLTT DOCUMENT-STYLE OPTION - released 17 December 1987
%    for LaTeX version 2.09
% Copyright (C) 1987 by Leslie Lamport

% Defines the `alltt' environment, which is like the `verbatim'
% environment except that `\', `\{', and `\}' have their usual meanings.
% Thus, other commands and environemnts can appear within an `alltt'
% environment.  Here are some things you may want to do in an `alltt'
% environment:
% 
% * Change fonts--e.g., by typing `{\em empasized text\/}'.
% 
% * Insert text from a file foo.tex by typing `input{foo}'.  Beware that
%   each <return> stars a new line, so if foo.tex ends with a <return>
%   you can wind up with an extra blank line if you're not careful.
% 
% * Insert a math formula.  Note that `$' just produces a dollar sign,
%   so you'll have to type `\(...\)' or `\[...\]'.  Also, `^' and `_'
%   just produce their characters; use `\sp' or `\sb' for super- and
%   subscripts, as in `\(x\sp{2}\)'.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

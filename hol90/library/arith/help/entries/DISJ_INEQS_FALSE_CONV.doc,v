@\DOC DISJ_INEQS_FALSE_CONV

\TYPE {DISJ_INEQS_FALSE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves a disjunction of conjunctions of normalised inequalities is false,
provided each conjunction is unsatisfiable.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
{DISJ_INEQS_FALSE_CONV} converts an unsatisfiable normalised arithmetic
formula to false. The formula must be a disjunction of conjunctions of
less-than-or-equal-to inequalities. The inequalities must have the following
form: Each variable must appear on only one side of the inequality and each
side must be a linear sum in which any constant appears first followed by
products of a constant and a variable. On each side the variables must be
ordered lexicographically, and if the coefficient of the variable is {1}, the
{1} must appear explicitly.

\FAILURE
Fails if the formula is not of the correct form or is satisfiable. The
function will also fail on certain unsatisfiable formulae due to
incompleteness of the procedure used.

\EXAMPLE
{
#DISJ_INEQS_FALSE_CONV
# "(1 * n) <= ((1 * m) + (1 * p)) /\
#  ((1 * m) + (1 * p)) <= (1 * n) /\
#  (5 + (4 * n)) <= ((3 * m) + (1 * p)) \/
#  2 <= 0";;
|- (1 * n) <= ((1 * m) + (1 * p)) /\
   ((1 * m) + (1 * p)) <= (1 * n) /\
   (5 + (4 * n)) <= ((3 * m) + (1 * p)) \/
   2 <= 0 =
   F

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC WSEG_WSEG_CONV

\TYPE {WSEG_WSEG_CONV : term -> conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, word.

\LIBRARY word

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the result of taking a segment from a segment of
a word.

\DESCRIBE
For any word {w} of size {n}, the result of evaluating
{
   WSEG_WSEG_CONV "n" "WSEG m2 k2 (WSEG m1 k1 w)"
}
\noindent where {m2}, {k2}, {m1} and {k1} must be numeric constants,
is the theorem
{
   PWORDLEN n w |- WSEG m2 k2 (WSEG m1 k1 w) = WSEG m2 k w
}
\noindent where {k} is a numeric constant whose value is the sum of
{k1} and {k2}.

\FAILURE
{WSEG_WSEG_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not of the form described above,
or the relations {k1 + m1 <= n} and {k2 + m2 <= m1} are not satisfied.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

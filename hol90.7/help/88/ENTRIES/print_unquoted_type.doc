\DOC print_unquoted_type

\TYPE {print_unquoted_type : (type -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a HOL type to the terminal without surrounding quotes and without the
leading colon.

\DESCRIBE
{print_unquoted_type ty} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing
the value of {ty} to the terminal without surrounding quotes and without the
leading colon. The text is not terminated with a carriage return. In fact, the
text is queued until the pretty-printer decides where line breaks are needed,
or until the queue is explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_unquoted_type ":bool";;
bool() : void
}

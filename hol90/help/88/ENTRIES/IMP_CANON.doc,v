@\DOC IMP_CANON

\TYPE {IMP_CANON : (thm -> thm list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Puts theorem into a `canonical' form.

\KEYWORDS
rule, canonical, implication.

\DESCRIBE
{IMP_CANON} puts a theorem in `canonical' form by removing quantifiers
and breaking apart conjunctions, as well as disjunctions which form the
antecedent of implications. It applies the following transformation rules:
{
      A |- t1 /\ t2           A |- !x. t           A |- (t1 /\ t2) ==> t
   -------------------       ------------         ------------------------
    A |- t1   A |- t2           A |- t             A |- t1 ==> (t2 ==> t)

        A |- (t1 \/ t2) ==> t              A |- (?x. t1) ==> t2
   -------------------------------        ----------------------
    A |- t1 ==> t   A |- t2 ==> t          A |- t1[x'/x] ==> t2
}
\FAILURE
Never fails, but if there is no scope for one of the above reductions,
merely gives a list whose only member is the original theorem.

\COMMENTS
This is a rather ad-hoc inference rule, and its use is not recommended.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {read : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reads a character from a file.

\KEYWORDS
file.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a string describing a port (a port is the standard ML file
descriptor, normally obtained from a call to {openi}), the function {read}
reads in a character from that port, and advances the internal state so that a
subsequent call to {read} will return the next character. When the end of the
file is reached, the multi-character string `nil` will be returned.

\FAILURE
May fail or hang in system-dependent ways when given an invalid port
descriptor.

\EXAMPLE
The following assumes that HOL is being run under Unix. It will overwrite an
existing file {test-file} in the current directory. Notice that the actual
string returned by {openi} may vary on other systems.
{
   #system `echo "Hi" >test-file`;;
   0 : int

   #let port = openi `test-file`;;
   port = `%test-file` : string

   #read port, read port, read port, read port, read port;;
   (`H`, `i`, `
   `, `nil`, `nil`)
   : (string # string # string # string # string)

   #close port;;
   () : void
}

\label{theorems}

The sections that follow list all theorems in the \ml{pred\_sets} library,
including definitions. The theorems are grouped into sections according to
subject matter. Some theorems could be classified under more than one subject,
but each theorem is listed in only one section. The reader may therefore have
to consult more than one section when searching for any particular theorem.

When the \ml{pred\_sets} library is loaded, all the theorems listed in this
chapter (including definitions) are set up to autoload when their names are
mentioned in \ML.

@\DOC BEGIN_STACK

\TYPE {BEGIN_STACK : (string -> term -> term list -> thm list -> unit)}

\SYNOPSIS
Create a window stack.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{BEGIN_STACK "name" `r f` hyps thms} creates a new window stack
containing a single window with: focus {`f`}, relation {`r`},
hypotheses {hyps}, relevant theorems {thms} and suppositions {[]}.
The new stack has the name {"name"} and is made the current stack.

\FAILURE
{BEGIN_STACK "name" `r f` hyps thms} fails if there already exists
a window stack called {"name"}.  It will also fail if the term it is
passed is not of the form `r f` where `r` is one of the relations that
have been declared to the window inference system.

\USES
Use this command to start an interactive reasoning session.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

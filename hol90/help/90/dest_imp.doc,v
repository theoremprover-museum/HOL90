@\DOC dest_imp

\TYPE {dest_imp : term -> {{ant :term, conseq :term}}}

\SYNOPSIS
Breaks apart an implication (or negation) into antecedent and consequent.

\DESCRIBE
{dest_imp} is a term destructor for implications, which treats negations as
implications with consequent {F}. Thus
{
   dest_imp (--`t1 ==> t2`--)
}
\noindent returns
{
   {{ant = t1, conseq = t2}}
}
\noindent and also
{
   dest_imp (--`~t`--)
}
\noindent returns
{
   {{ant = t, conseq = (--`F`--)}}
}

\FAILURE
Fails with 

    HOL_ERR{{origin_structure = "Dsyntax", origin_function = "dest_imp", 
            message = "not an ==>"}}

if term is neither an implication nor a negation.

\COMMENTS
Destructs negations for increased functionality of HOL-style resolution.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

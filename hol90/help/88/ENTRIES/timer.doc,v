@\DOC timer

\TYPE {timer : (bool -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Switches timing and inference-counting on or off.

\DESCRIBE
A call {timer true} switches on timing and inference-counting; {timer false}
switches it off. In either case, the previous on/off setting ({true} means on)
is returned. When switched on, the CPU (and, if relevant, garbage collection)
time and the number of intermediate theorems generated is displayed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
This example was run from a state with timings initially switched off:
{
   #let th = SPEC "x:num" (theorem `arithmetic` `ADD1`);;
   th = |- SUC x = x + 1
   Run time: 0.0s
   Intermediate theorems generated: 1

   #ONCE_REWRITE_RULE[EQ_SYM_EQ] th;;
   |- x + 1 = SUC x
   Run time: 0.1s
   Intermediate theorems generated: 11

   #SYM th;;
   |- x + 1 = SUC x
   Run time: 0.0s
   Intermediate theorems generated: 1
}
\USES
Guiding the optimization of important proofs.

\COMMENTS
The same effect can be achieved by setting the flag {timing}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

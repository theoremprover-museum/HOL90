\DOC print_string

\TYPE {print_string : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints an ML string to the terminal (without surrounding string quotes).

\DESCRIBE
{print_string s} returns {():void} with the side-effect of printing the string
{s} to the terminal. String quotes are not printed around the string, and the
text is not terminated with a carriage return. In fact, the text is queued
until the pretty-printer decides where line breaks are needed, or until the
queue is explicitly flushed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#print_string `This is an example`;;
This is an example() : void
}
\SEEALSO
print_tok, message, print_begin, print_end, print_newline.

@\DOC PALPHA

\TYPE {PALPHA : (term -> term -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, alpha.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Proves equality of paired alpha-equivalent terms.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {t1} and {t1'} which are
alpha-equivalent, {ALPHA} returns the theorem {|- t1 = t1'}.
{

   -------------  PALPHA "t1" "t1'"
    |- t1 = t1'
}
The difference between {PALPHA} and {ALPHA} is that 
{PALPHA} is prepared to consider pair structures of different
structure to be alpha-equivalent.
In its most trivial case this means that {PALPHA} can consider
a variable and a pair to alpha-equivalent.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the terms provided are alpha-equivalent.

\EXAMPLE
{
#PALPHA "\(x:*,y:*). (x,y)" "\xy:*#*.xy";;
|- (\(x,y). (x,y)) = (\xy. xy)
}
\COMMENTS
The system shows the type of {PALPHA} as {term -> conv}.

Alpha-converting a paired abstraction to a nonpaired abstraction 
can introduce instances of the terms {"FST"} and {"SND"}.
A paired abstraction and a nonpaired abstraction will be considered
equivalent by {PALPHA} if the nonpaired abstraction contains all
those instances of {"FST"} and {"SND"} present in the paired
abstraction, plus the minimum additional instances of {"FST"} and {"SND"}.
For example:
{
   #PALPHA
      "\(x:*,y:**). (f x y (x,y)):***"
      "\xy:*#**. (f (FST xy) (SND xy) xy):***";;
   |- (\(x,y). f x y(x,y)) = (\xy. f(FST xy)(SND xy)xy)

   #PALPHA
      "\(x:*,y:**). (f x y (x,y)):***"
      "\xy:*#**. (f (FST xy) (SND xy) (FST xy, SND xy)):***";;
   evaluation failed     PALPHA
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

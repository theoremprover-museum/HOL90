@\DOC FRONT_CONJ_CONV

\TYPE {FRONT_CONJ_CONV: (term list -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a specified conjunct to the beginning of a conjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conjunction, associative, commutative.

\DESCRIBE
Given a list of boolean terms {[t1;...;t;...;tn]} and a term {t} which occurs
in the list, {FRONT_CONJ_CONV} returns:
{
   |- (t1 /\ ... /\ t /\ ... /\ tn) = (t /\ t1 /\ ... /\ tn)
}
\noindent That is, {FRONT_CONJ_CONV} proves that {t} can be moved to the
`front' of a conjunction of several terms.

\FAILURE
{FRONT_CONJ_CONV ["t1";...;"tn"] "t"} fails if {t} does not occur in the list
{[t1,...,tn]} or if any of {t1}, ..., {tn} do not have type {bool}.

\COMMENTS
This is not a true conversion, so perhaps it ought to be called something else.
The system shows its type as {(term list -> conv)}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

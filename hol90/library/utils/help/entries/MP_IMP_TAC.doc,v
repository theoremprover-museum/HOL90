MP_IMP_TAC : thm_tactic
}

\LIBRARY utils

\SYNOPSIS
The tactic {MP_IMP_TAC thm} uses modus ponens with the theorem {thm}
to reduce a goal.

\DESCRIBE
The tactic {MP_IMP_TAC thm} where {thm} is a theorem of the form
{B |- s ==> t}, when epplied to the goal {A ?- s} returns the subgoal {A ?- t}.  If {hypi}
is a hypothesis of {thm} which does not occor among the assumptions {A},
then the subgoal {A ?- hypi} is also returned.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

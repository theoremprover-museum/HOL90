rule, epsilon.

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces a paired existential quantification in place of a paired choice.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {PEXISTS_RULE} expects a theorem asserting that
{(@p. t)} denotes a pair for which {t} holds.
The equivalent assertion that there exists a {p} for which {t} holds is
returned.
{
    A |- t[(@p. t)/p]
   ------------------  PEXISTS_RULE
       A |- ?p. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a theorem the conclusion of which is not
of the form {(t[(@p.t)/p])}.

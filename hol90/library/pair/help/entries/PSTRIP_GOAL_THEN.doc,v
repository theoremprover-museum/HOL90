@\DOC PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN

\TYPE {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN : (thm_tactic -> tactic)}

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Splits a goal by eliminating one outermost connective, applying the
given theorem-tactic to the antecedents of implications.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem-tactic {ttac} and a goal {(A,t)}, {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN} removes one
outermost occurrence of one of the connectives {!}, {==>}, {~} or {/\} from the
conclusion of the goal {t}.  If {t} is a universally quantified term, then
{STRIP_GOAL_THEN} strips off the quantifier.   Note that {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN}
will strip off paired universal quantifications.
{
      A ?- !p. u
   ==============  PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac
    A ?- u[p'/p]
}
\noindent where {p'} is a primed variant that contains no variables that
appear free in the assumptions {A}.  If {t} is a conjunction,
then {PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN} simply splits
the conjunction into two subgoals:
{
      A ?- v /\ w
   =================  PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac
    A ?- v   A ?- w
}
\noindent If {t} is an implication {"u ==> v"} and if:
{
      A ?- v
  ===============  ttac (u |- u)
     A' ?- v'
}
\noindent then:
{
      A ?- u ==> v
  ====================  PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac
        A' ?- v'
}
\noindent Finally, a negation {~t} is treated as the implication {t ==> F}.

\FAILURE
{PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN ttac (A,t)} fails if {t} is not a paired universally
quantified term, an implication, a negation or a conjunction.  
Failure also occurs if the application of {ttac} fails,
after stripping the goal.

\USES
{PSTRIP_GOAL_THEN} is used when manipulating intermediate results (obtained by
stripping outer connectives from a goal) directly, rather than as assumptions.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

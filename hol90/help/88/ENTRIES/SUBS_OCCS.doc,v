@\DOC SUBS_OCCS

\TYPE {SUBS_OCCS : ((int list # thm) list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes substitutions in a theorem at specific occurrences of a term, using a
list of equational theorems.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
Given a list {(l1,A1|-t1=v1),...,(ln,An|-tn=vn)} and a theorem
{(A|-t)}, {SUBS_OCCS} simultaneously replaces each {ti} in {t} with {vi},
at the occurrences specified by the integers
in the list {li = [o1;...;ok]} for each theorem {Ai|-ti=vi}.
{
     (l1,A1|-t1=v1) ... (ln,An|-tn=vn)  A|-t
   -------------------------------------------  SUBS_OCCS[(l1,A1|-t1=v1);...;
    A1 u ... An u A |- t[v1,...,vn/t1,...,tn]            (ln,An|-tn=vn)] (A|-t)
}
\FAILURE
{SUBS_OCCS [(l1,th1);...;(ln,thn)] (A|-t)} fails if
the conclusion of any theorem in the list is not an equation.
No change is made to the theorem if the supplied occurrences {li} of the
left-hand side of the conclusion of {thi} do not appear in {t}.

\EXAMPLE
The commutative law for addition
{
   #let thm = SPECL ["m:num"; "n:num"] ADD_SYM;;
   thm = |- m + n = n + m
}
\noindent can be used for substituting only the second occurrence of
the subterm {m + n}
{
   #SUBS_OCCS [([2],thm)] (ASSUME "(n + m) + (m + n) = (m + n) + (m + n)");;
   . |- (n + m) + (m + n) = (n + m) + (m + n)
}
\USES
{SUBS_OCCS} is used when rewriting at specific occurrences of a term, and rules
such as {REWRITE_RULE}, {PURE_REWRITE_RULE}, {ONCE_REWRITE_RULE}, and {SUBS}
are too extensive or would diverge.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

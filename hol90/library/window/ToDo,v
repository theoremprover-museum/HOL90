@Work the RCS Version number into the Manual.

Make UNDO take a number: the number of steps to undo.
Make REDO take a number: the number of steps to redo.

Add a user level command to set the history size of the current stack.
Add a user level comand to set the default history size.

Add a SET_CURRENT_STACK command that takes a stack and makes it the
current stack.  This can then be used in conjunction with 
CURRENT_STACK to save and restore the proof state.

Move the definition of "boundin" so it can be hidden.

Move the definition of prove_hyp so it can be hidden.

Make END_STACK_TAC Take no parameter, or rather, make it take the sort of
parameter that is usually handed to a tactic and hand it on that way we 
wont have to call it with ().

Change the printing of the stack so that it prints "Window: depth" before
the stack.

The window rules for conditionals should be such that when opening
a subwindow on A in if(A,B,C) we can assume that ~(B=C).

Redo the core of the system so that the functions match_transform_win,
convert_win, rule_win, thm_rule_win, foc_rule_win, tactic_win
are cut out of the core and the uppercase versions are implemented directly
in terms of transform_win.

Give it to Laurent to port the Centaur front end.

Most window inference rules can be captured by theorems of the form
(|- (A ==> (f r f')) ==> (F f) R (F f'))
Write a function that takes theorems of that form a returns an inference
rule.
Use it to replace much of the window close rule code. 
You should even be able to wrap up the quantifier window rules in a therem
if the generalised over the bound variable on the top line.

Make it so that adding realtions gives them an identifier so they can
be deleted later.   Maybe tie window rules into this relation too so they
can be deleted with the relation.

Make it so individual signal handlers have and id so they can be dropped one
at a time.

Speed up weaken by making weak_table store the theorem too.

Make it so you can tell the system that certain relations are oposits i.e.
be able to add the formula "!x y. x ==> y = y <== x".   Then let transform
window be able swap the sence of a theorem to match the sence of the 
window.
OR
Make it so that instead of there being two relations i.e. ==> and <==, there
is just one + a concept of sence of either + or -.

Redo win.sml with a new ADT (a b stack) (window close stack)

Use the module feature of SML to reduce the number of global bindings made.

Rename "add_weak" to "add_stronger", read the intro section of the manual and
you will realise that it makes more sence.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

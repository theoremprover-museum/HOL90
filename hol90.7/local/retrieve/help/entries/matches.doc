\TYPE {op matches : ((term * term) -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Side-condition test. Tests the value bound to a pattern variable to see if
it matches a new pattern.

\DESCRIBE
{matches} can be used to test whether part of a hypothesis or conclusion
is a term that matches a specified pattern. Its first argument is a variable
used in a pattern for the hypothesis/conclusion. The other argument is the
pattern to be matched with the term to which the variable has been bound. The
pattern is only tested directly against the term; no attempt is made to match
inside the term.

\FAILURE
Fails if the first argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

\EXAMPLE
Here is a pattern that matches a theorem if the conclusion is an equality in
which the right-hand side is a conjunction:
{
   (conc (--`l = (r:bool)`--)) Where ((--`r:bool`--) matches (--`x /\ y`--))
}
\noindent In this simple example, we could equally well have used the following
pattern:
{
   conc (--`l = (x /\ y)`--)
}

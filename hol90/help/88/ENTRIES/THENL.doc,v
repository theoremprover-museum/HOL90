@\DOC THENL

\TYPE {$THENL : (tactic -> tactic list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a list of tactics to the corresponding subgoals generated by a tactic.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
If {T,T1,...,Tn} are tactics, {T THENL [T1;...;Tn]} is a tactic which applies
{T} to a goal, and if it does not fail, applies the tactics {T1,...,Tn} to the
corresponding subgoals, unless {T} completely solves the goal.

\FAILURE
The application of {THENL} to a tactic and tactic list never fails.
The resulting tactic fails if {T} fails when applied to the goal, or if
the goal list is not empty and its length is not the same as that of the
tactic list, or finally if {Ti} fails when applied to the {i}'th subgoal
generated by {T}.

\USES
Applying different tactics to different subgoals.

\SEEALSO
EVERY, ORELSE, THEN.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

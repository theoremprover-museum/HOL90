NOTE CONCERNING REVISIONS TO THE pred_sets LIBRARY
--------------------------------------------------

The pred_sets library has been completely rewritten for HOL88 version
2.01.  In particular, the library pred_sets has been made exactly
parallel to the sets library, with the same names for theorems, the
same form of definitions, and an almost identical manual.

Users of older versions of the library should note that:

   * dependence on the fixpoints library is gone.
   * the constant BOT is now called EMPTY
   * there are the following rough correspondences between
     the old and new theorems and definitions in pred_sets:

     old                               new
     --------------------------        -----------------
     FUN_ONE_ONE (>-->)                INJ_DEF (INJ)
     FUN_ONTO    (-->>)		       SURJ_DEF (SURJ)
     ONTO_IMAGE			       IMAGE_SURJ
     IMAGE_COMP			       IMAGE_COMPOSE
     FUN_ISO			       BIJ_DEF
     FUN_IDEN			       INJ_ID, SURJ_ID, BIJ_ID
     FUN_COMP			       INJ_COMPOSE, SURJ_COMPOSE, BIJ_COMPOSE
     IMAGE_COMP			       IMAGE_COMPOSE
     BOTTOM_LEFT,BOTTOM_RIGHT	       INJ_EMPTY, SURJ_EMPTY, BIJ_EMPTY
     NOT_BOT			       MEMBER_NOT_EMPTY
     INJ_FINV			       LINV_DEF
     SURJ_FINV			       RINV_DEF

The old version of pred_sets is contained in the directory OLD,
which will eventually be deleted.

\TYPE {test1term : ((term -> bool) -> term -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function for generating a side-condition test from a predicate.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
{test1term} takes a predicate and a term as arguments and produces a
side-condition test. The term is a pattern variable. When the side-condition
comes to be applied, the pattern variable is looked up in the binding created
by the match. The bound object is then fed to the predicate. The side-condition
succeeds or fails based on the Boolean result.

Note that user defined functions which indicate a failure to match by raising
an exception should do so with the exception {NO_MATCH}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term argument is not a variable. May also cause a failure to
match, when used in a search, if the pattern variable does not appear in the
binding.

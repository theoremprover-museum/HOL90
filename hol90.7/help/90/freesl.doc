\TYPE {Compat.freesl : term list -> term list}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of the free variables in a list of terms.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. When applied to a list of terms, {freesl}
returns a list of the variables which are free in any of those
terms. There are no repetitions in the list produced even if several
terms contain the same free variable.

\FAILURE
Never fails, unless the hol88 library has not been loaded.

\EXAMPLE
In the following example there are two free instances each of {x} and {y},
whereas the only instances of {z} are bound:
{
   - freesl [(--`x+y=2`--), (--`!z. z >= (x-y)`--)];
   val it = [(--`x`--),(--`y`--)] : term list
}
\COMMENTS
{freesl} is not in hol90; use {free_varsl} instead. WARNING: One can not
depend on the order of the list returned by {freesl} to be identical to that 
returned by {free_varsl}. They are coded in terms of {frees} and {free_vars}, 
and thus the discussion in the documentation for {frees} applies by extension.

@\DOC PRUNE_CONV

\TYPE {PRUNE_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Prunes all hidden variables.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{PRUNE_CONV "?l1 ... lr. t1 /\ ... /\ eqn1 /\ ... /\ eqnr /\ ... /\ tp"}
returns a theorem of the form:
{
   |- (?l1 ... lr. t1 /\ ... /\ eqn1 /\ ... /\ eqnr /\ ... /\ tp) =
      (t1 /\ ... /\ tp)
}
\noindent where each {eqni} has the form {"!y1 ... ym. li x1 ... xn = b"} and
{li} does not appear free in any of the other conjuncts or in {b}. The
conversion works if one or more of the {eqni}'s are not present, that is if
{li} is not free in any of the conjuncts, but does not work if {li} appears
free in more than one of the conjuncts. {p} may be zero, that is, all the
conjuncts may be {eqni}'s. In this case the result will be simply {T} (true).
Also, for each {eqni}, {m} and {n} may be zero.

\FAILURE
Fails if the argument term is not of the specified form or if any of the
{li}'s are free in more than one of the conjuncts or if the equation for any
{li} is recursive.

\EXAMPLE
{
#PRUNE_CONV
# "?l2 l1.
#   (!(x:num). l1 x = F) /\ (!x. l2 x = ~(out x)) /\ (!(x:num). out x = T)";;
|- (?l2 l1. (!x. l1 x = F) /\ (!x. l2 x = ~out x) /\ (!x. out x = T)) =
   (!x. out x = T)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

1.4
log
@The HOL90 sources have been changed to allow for the use of different
Standard ML compilers (possibly simultaneously).

 * Many files in "src/0" changed to make them more portable across different
   ML compilers. Various additions have been made to the Portable structure
   and files changed to access identifiers in the Portable structure rather
   than from the global environment. Worthy of special note are:

   - The pointer equality used in "src/0/term.sml" has been made into a
     function in the Portable structure.

   - The ML-Lex and ML-Yacc files for the various parsers have been changed
     to access the Portable structure. Both the source files and the SML
     produced from them have been changed but I have not verified that the
     source files would reproduce the new SML versions if ML-Lex and ML-Yacc
     were to be rerun on them. The changes involve some hacks that exploit the
     way ML-Lex and ML-Yacc work. See the sources for details.

@Removed files are parse files and portability files that have
effectively been moved elsewhere.

Modified files are up to date for ML 109.26.

@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

@Check in after merging in Konrad's changes made after
the release of hol90.7.  This involved creating a side branch
in which to check in Konrad's changes, then merging in that
side branch into the main development (which contains changes
made by Elsa Gunter).

Some other small modification have been made to the source code,
as I begun to try to make this version into a working version:
	- hol90 will now be compiled in an environment were no
structures can be considered opn.  This means many structures
now need "open Lib" and other such commands at their head.
This has not yet been completed, but has been begun.
	- "rotl" and "rotr" have been added to Lib, something
which I just did impulsively.   Documentation files
have also been added in help/90.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

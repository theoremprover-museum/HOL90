\SYNOPSIS
Splits a theorem into a list of theorems and then adds them to the assumptions.

\DESCRIBE
Given a theorem {th} and a goal {(A,t)}, {PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC th} splits {th} into
a list of theorems. This is done by recursively breaking conjunctions into
separate conjuncts, cases-splitting disjunctions, and eliminating paired
existential quantifiers by choosing arbitrary variables.  Schematically,
the following rules are applied:
{
           A ?- t
   ======================  PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v1 /\ ... /\ vn)
    A u {{v1,...,vn}} ?- t

                A ?- t
   =================================  PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- v1 \/ ... \/ vn)
    A u {{v1}} ?- t ... A u {{vn}} ?- t

          A ?- t
   ====================  PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A' |- ?p. v)
    A u {{v[p'/p]}} ?- t
}
\noindent where {p'} is a variant of the pair {p}.

If the conclusion of {th} is not a conjunction, a disjunction or a paired
existentially quantified term, the whole theorem {th} is added to the
assumptions.

As assumptions are generated, they are examined to see if they solve the goal
(either by being alpha-equivalent to the conclusion of the goal or by deriving
a contradiction).

The assumptions of the theorem being split are not added to the assumptions of
the goal(s), but they are recorded in the proof.  This means that if {A'} is
not a subset of the assumptions {A} of the goal (up to alpha-conversion),
{PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC (A'|-v)} results in an invalid tactic.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\USES
{PSTRIP_ASSUME_TAC} is used when applying a previously proved theorem to solve
a goal, or when enriching its assumptions so that resolution,
rewriting with assumptions and other operations involving assumptions have
more to work with.

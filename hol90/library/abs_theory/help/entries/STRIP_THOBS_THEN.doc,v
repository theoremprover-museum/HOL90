@\DOC STRIP_THOBS_THEN

\TYPE {STRIP_THOBS_THEN : thm_tactic -> tactic}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS 
Strips an explicitly declared theory obligation from a goal,
expands it, and applies the theorem tactic to the result.

\DESCRIBE
Removes one explicitly declared theory obligation from a goal
substituting the definition of the theory obligation for the
name.  The abstract object may or may not be universally quantified. The
result is used as an argument to the theorem-tactic.


\FAILURE 
Fails if theory obligation list is empty (e.g. can occur when no
abstract parent has been declared).

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

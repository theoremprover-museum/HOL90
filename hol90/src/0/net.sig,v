1.2
log
@Check in after merging in Konrad's changes made after
the release of hol90.7.  This involved creating a side branch
in which to check in Konrad's changes, then merging in that
side branch into the main development (which contains changes
made by Elsa Gunter).

Some other small modification have been made to the source code,
as I begun to try to make this version into a working version:
	- hol90 will now be compiled in an environment were no
structures can be considered opn.  This means many structures
now need "open Lib" and other such commands at their head.
This has not yet been completed, but has been begun.
	- "rotl" and "rotr" have been added to Lib, something
which I just did impulsively.   Documentation files
have also been added in help/90.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

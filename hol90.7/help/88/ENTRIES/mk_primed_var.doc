\DOC mk_primed_var

\TYPE {mk_primed_var : ((string # type) -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Primes a variable name sufficiently to make it distinct from all constants.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a string {`v`} and a type {":ty"}, the function {mk_primed_var}
constructs a variable whose name consists of {v} followed by however many
primes are necessary to make it distinct from any constants in the current
theory.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#new_theory `wombat`;;
() : void

#mk_primed_var(`x`,":bool");;
"x" : term

#new_constant(`x`,":num");;
() : void

#mk_primed_var(`x`,":bool");;
"x'" : term
}

@\DOC RESQ_HALF_GEN_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_HALF_GEN_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips the outermost restricted universal quantifier from
the conclusion of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, restricted quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a goal {A ?- !x::P. t}, {RESQ_GEN_TAC}
reduces it to {A ?- !x. P x ==> t} which is the underlying semantic
representation of the restricted universal quantification.
{
     A ?- !x::P. t
   ====================  RESQ_HALF_GEN_TAC
    A ?- !x. P x ==> t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the goal's conclusion is a restricted universal quantification.

\USES
The tactic {REPEAT RESQ_GEN_TAC} strips away a series of restricted
universal quantifiers, and is commonly used before tactics relying on
the  underlying term structure.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

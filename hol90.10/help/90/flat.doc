\TYPE {Compat.flat : ('a list list -> 'a list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Flattens a list of lists into one long list.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. {flat [l1,...,ln]} returns {(l1 @ ... @ ln)} 
where each li is a list and {@} is list concatenation.

\FAILURE
Never fails, unless the hol88 library has not been loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - flat [[1,2],[3,4,5],[6]];
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] : int list
}

\COMMENTS
{flat} is not in hol90; for some unknown reason, the author used {flatten} 
instead.

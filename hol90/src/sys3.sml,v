1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

1.1.1.1.4.1
log
@Theory files now build with SML/NJ 109, SML/NJ 108.5 (using CM), SML/NJ 0.93,
and Poly/ML 3.0.
The quotation filter has been modified so that antiquotation works correctly
in old-style quotations.
The quotation filter is now compiled using flex and gcc (by default).
The arguments to the script for running hol90 have been changed.

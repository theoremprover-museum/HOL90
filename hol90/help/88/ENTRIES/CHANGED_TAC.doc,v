@\DOC CHANGED_TAC

\TYPE {CHANGED_TAC : (tactic -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes a tactic fail if it has no effect.

\KEYWORDS
tactical.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a tactic {T}, the tactical {CHANGED_TAC} gives a new tactic
which is the same as {T} if that has any effect, and otherwise fails.

\FAILURE
The application of {CHANGED_TAC} to a tactic never fails. The resulting
tactic fails if the basic tactic either fails or has no effect.

\SEEALSO
TRY, VALID.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC

\TYPE {MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Solves a goal which is an instance of the supplied theorem.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When given a theorem {A' |- t} and a goal {A ?- t'} where {t} can be matched
to {t'} by instantiating variables which are either free or
universally quantified at the outer level, including appropriate type
instantiation, {MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC} completely solves the goal.
{
    A ?- t'
   =========  MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC (A' |- t)

}
\noindent Unless {A'} is a subset of {A}, this is an invalid tactic.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem has a conclusion which is instantiable to match that
of the goal.

\EXAMPLE
The following example shows variable and type instantiation at work. We can use
the polymorphic list theorem {HD}:
{
   HD = |- !h t. HD(CONS h t) = h
}
\noindent to solve the goal:
{
   ?- HD [1;2] = 1
}
\noindent simply by:
{
   MATCH_ACCEPT_TAC HD
}
\SEEALSO
ACCEPT_TAC.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

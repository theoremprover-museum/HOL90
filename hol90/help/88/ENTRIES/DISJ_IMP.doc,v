@\DOC DISJ_IMP

\TYPE {DISJ_IMP : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Converts a disjunctive theorem to an equivalent implicative theorem.

\KEYWORDS
rule, disjunction, implication.

\DESCRIBE
The left disjunct of a disjunctive theorem becomes the negated
antecedent of the newly generated theorem.
{
     A |- t1 \/ t2
   -----------------  DISJ_IMP
    A |- ~t1 ==> t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not a disjunction.

\EXAMPLE
Specializing the built-in theorem {LESS_CASES} gives the theorem:
{
   th = |- m < n \/ n <= m
}
\noindent to which {DISJ_IMP} may be applied:
{
   #DISJ_IMP th;;
   |- ~m < n ==> n <= m
}
\SEEALSO
DISJ_CASES.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {special_symbols : (void -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of special symbols.

\DESCRIBE
An identifier, at the ML or object level, is either alphanumeric, e.g. {true}
or {T}, or consists of a special symbol which starts with a non-alphanumeric
character, e.g. {==>} or {+}. It is a consequence of the non-backtracking
implementation of lexical analysis that any (non-null) initial segment of a
special symbol is also a special symbol, so from the above we know that {==}
and {=} are. The function {special_symbols} returns a list of special symbols;
all non-null initial prefixes of them are also special symbols.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

@\DOC UNWIND_AUTO_CONV

\TYPE {UNWIND_AUTO_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Automatic unwinding of equations defining wire values in a standard device
specification.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{UNWIND_AUTO_CONV "?l1 ... lm. t1 /\ ... /\ tn"} returns a theorem of the form:
{
   |- (?l1 ... lm. t1 /\ ... /\ tn) = (?l1 ... lm. t1' /\ ... /\ tn')
}
\noindent where {tj'} is {tj} rewritten with equations selected from the
{ti}'s.

The function decides which equations to use for rewriting by performing a loop
analysis on the graph representing the dependencies of the lines. By this means
the term can be unwound as much as possible without the risk of looping. The
user is left to deal with the recursive equations.

\FAILURE
Fails if there is more than one equation for any line variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
#UNWIND_AUTO_CONV
# "(!(x:num). l1 x = (l2 x) - 1) /\
#  (!x. f x = (l2 (x+1)) + (l1 (x+2))) /\
#  (!x. l2 x = 7)";;
|- (!x. l1 x = (l2 x) - 1) /\
   (!x. f x = (l2(x + 1)) + (l1(x + 2))) /\
   (!x. l2 x = 7) =
   (!x. l1 x = 7 - 1) /\ (!x. f x = 7 + (7 - 1)) /\ (!x. l2 x = 7)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

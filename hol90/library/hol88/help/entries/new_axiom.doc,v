@\DOC new_axiom

\TYPE {Compat.new_axiom : (string * term) -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets up a new axiom in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {tm} is a term of type {bool}, a call {new_axiom("name",tm)} creates a
theorem
{
   |- !x1..xn. tm
}
\noindent and stores it away in the theory file. Note that all free variables
in {tm} are generalized automatically before the axiom is set up.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode, or there is already an axiom or definition
of that name in the current theory, or it the given term does not have type
{bool}.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - new_theory "gurk";
  () : unit

  - new_axiom("untrue",--`x = 1`--));
  |- !x. x = 1
}
\COMMENTS
hol90 doesn't have {new_axiom}; use {new_open_axiom} instead, which does
not automatically generalize the term being asserted as an axiom. For
most purposes, it is unnecessary to declare new axioms: all of classical
mathematics can be derived by definitional extension alone. Proceeding
by definition is not only more elegant, but also guarantees the
consistency of the deductions made. However, there are certain entities
which cannot be modelled in simple type theory without further axioms,
such as higher transfinite ordinals.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

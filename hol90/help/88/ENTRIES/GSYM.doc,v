@\DOC GSYM

\TYPE {GSYM : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a top-down search.

\KEYWORDS
rule, symmetry, equality.

\DESCRIBE
The inference rule {GSYM} reverses the first equation(s) encountered in a
top-down search of the conclusion of the argument theorem. An equation will be
reversed iff it is not a proper subterm of another equation. If a theorem
contains no equations, it will be returned unchanged.
{
    A |- ..(s1 = s2)...(t1 = t2)..
   --------------------------------  GSYM
    A |- ..(s2 = s1)...(t2 = t1)..
}
\FAILURE
Never fails, and never loops infinitely.

\EXAMPLE
{
#ADD;;
|- (!n. 0 + n = n) /\ (!m n. (SUC m) + n = SUC(m + n))
Run time: 0.0s

#GSYM ADD;;
|- (!n. n = 0 + n) /\ (!m n. SUC(m + n) = (SUC m) + n)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

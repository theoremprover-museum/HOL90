\TYPE {extend_theory : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Allows an existing theory to be extended.

\DESCRIBE
Calling {extend_theory `thy`} loads the existing theory {thy} into the system
and makes it the current theory. The message `{Theory thy loaded}' is printed.
The theory is entered in draft mode. This allows new axioms, constants, types,
constant specifications, infix constants, binders and parents to be added to
the theory segment. Inconsistencies may be introduced to the theory if
inconsistent axioms are asserted.  New theorems can also be added as when in
proof mode. If new type or constant names are added to theory {thy} which
clash with names in any of its descendants, later attempts to load those
descendants will fail. The extensions to the theory segment might  not be
written to the theory file until the session is finished with a call to
{close_theory}. If HOL is quitted without closing the session with
{close_theory}, parts of the theory segment created during the session may be
lost. If the system is in draft mode when a call to {extend_theory} is made,
the previous session is closed; all changes made in it will be written to the
associated theory file.

\FAILURE
A call to {extend_theory `thy`} will fail if theory {thy} does not appear on
the current search path. It will fail unless theory {thy} is either the
current theory or a descendant of it. It will fail if any of the theory files
of the theory {thy} have been damaged. It will also fail if an ancestor of
theory {thy} has been extended with either new types or constants which clash
with names in theory {thy}. Since it could involve writing to the file
system, if a write fails for any reason {extend_theory} will fail. On failure,
the system recovers cleanly, unloading any theory segments it had loaded before
the failure was detected. It will diverge if the theory hierarchy within theory
{thy} contains loops, so that a theory segment is its own ancestor.

\USES
The normal way to build upon a theory is to use it as a parent. You should
only use {extend_theory} to add declarations, etc., that were mistakenly
omitted from a theory.

\COMMENTS
It would be difficult to implement the necessary checks to ensure that added
types, constants, etc., did not invalidate declarations in the descendant
theories.

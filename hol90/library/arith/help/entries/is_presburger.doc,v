@Support for the predecessor function, PRE, has been added to the arith
library. It is eliminated in the pre-processing phase along with natural
number subtraction. The modifications are due to Kim Dam Petersen of
Tele Danmark Research.

R.J.Boulton, 16th November 1995.

\TYPE {is_presburger : (term -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Determines whether a formula is in the Presburger subset of arithmetic.

\LIBRARY arith

\DESCRIBE
This function returns true if the argument term is a formula in the Presburger
subset of natural number arithmetic. Presburger natural arithmetic is the
subset of arithmetic formulae made up from natural number constants, numeric
variables, addition, multiplication by a constant, the natural number
relations {<}, {<=}, {=}, {>=}, {>} and the logical connectives {~}, {/\},
{\/}, {==>}, {=} (if-and-only-if), {!} (`forall') and {?} (`there exists').

Products of two expressions which both contain variables are not included in
the subset, but the function {SUC} which is not normally included in a
specification of Presburger arithmetic is allowed in this HOL implementation.
This function also considers subtraction and the predecessor function, {PRE},
to be part of the subset.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#is_presburger "!m n p. m < (2 * n) /\ (n + n) <= p ==> m < SUC p";;
true : bool

#is_presburger "!m n p q. m < (n * p) /\ (n * p) < q ==> m < q";;
false : bool

#is_presburger "(m <= n) ==> !p. (m < SUC(n + p))";;
true : bool

#is_presburger "(m + n) - m = n";;
true : bool
}
\USES
Useful for determining whether a decision procedure for Presburger arithmetic
is applicable to a term.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

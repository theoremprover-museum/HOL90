@\DOC PRINT_STACK

\TYPE {PRINT_WIN : (unit -> unit)}

\SYNOPSIS
Print out the top window of the current window stack.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{PRINT_STACK} will print out the top window on the stack according to
the following format.
{
     ! "a"
     | "l"
     ? "c"
     $ "u"
     @@ "b"
   R * "f"
}
That is, {PRINT_STACK} prints the context of the window followed by
{R * "f"} where {R} is the relation that the window is supposed to
preserve, and {"f"} is the focus of the window. Each element in the
context is preceded by some prefix.
The prefix {!} denotes an assumption.
The prefix {|} denotes a lemma.
The prefix {?} denotes a conjecture.
The prefix {$} denotes a used conjecture.
The prefix {@@} denotes a bad conjecture.

\FAILURE
{PRINT_STACK ()} will fail if there is no current window stack.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

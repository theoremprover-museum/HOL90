@\DOC FUN_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {FUN_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Equates normal and extensional equality for two functions.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, extentionality.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {FUN_EQ_CONV} embodies the fact that two functions are equal
precisely when they give the same results for all values to which they can be
applied. When supplied with a term argument of the form {f = g}, where {f} and
{g} are functions of type {ty1->ty2}, {FUN_EQ_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (f = g) = (!x. f x = g x)
}
\noindent where {x} is a variable of type {ty1} chosen by the conversion.

\FAILURE
{FUN_EQ_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not an equation {f = g}, where {f} and {g}
are functions.

\USES
Used for proving equality of functions.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\SYNOPSIS
Beta-reduces a top-level paired beta-redex on the right-hand side of an 
equation.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an equational theorem, {RIGHT_PBETA} applies paired
beta-reduction at top level to the right-hand side (only).
Variables are renamed if necessary to avoid free variable capture.
{
    A |- s = (\p. t1) t2
   ----------------------  RIGHT_PBETA
     A |- s = t1[t2/p]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is equational, with its right-hand side being
a top-level paired beta-redex.

\TYPE {Endofsearch : (foundthm list -> searchstep)}

\SYNOPSIS
Constructor function for the final step of a search.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
Searches proceed in steps, one theory segment at a time. At the end of the
search, the theorems found are presented using the constructor {Endofsearch}.
At intermediate steps, the name of the theory being searched is displayed. If
the search halts after an intermediate step, a list of theorems found so far
and a function to continue the search are returned.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO
Step, find_theorems, continue_search, show_step.

@\DOC infixes

\TYPE {infixes : (string -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Lists the infixes in the named theory.

\DESCRIBE
The function {infixes} should be applied to a string which is the name of an
ancestor theory (including the current theory; the special string {`-`} is
always interpreted as the current theory). It returns a list of all the infixes
declared in that theory.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theory is an ancestor of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
The theory {HOL} has no infixes:
{
   #infixes `HOL`;;
   [] : term list
}
\noindent but the theory {arithmetic} has several:
{
   #infixes `arithmetic`;;
   ["$DIV"; "$MOD"; "$>="; "$<="; "$>"; "$EXP"; "$*"; "$-"; "$+"]
   : term list
}
\SEEALSO

new_infix_definition, new_infix_list_rec_definition,
new_infix_prim_rec_definition, parents, types.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

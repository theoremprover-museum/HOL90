@\DOC PMATCH_MP_TAC

\TYPE {PMATCH_MP_TAC : thm_tactic}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, modus ponens, implication.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Reduces the goal using a supplied implication, with matching.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem of the form
{
   A' |- !p1...pn. s ==> !q1...qm. t
}
\noindent {PMATCH_MP_TAC} produces a tactic that reduces a goal whose
conclusion {t'} is a substitution and/or type instance of {t} to the
corresponding instance of {s}. Any variables free in {s} but not in {t} will
be existentially quantified in the resulting subgoal:
{
     A ?- !u1...ui. t'
  ======================  PMATCH_MP_TAC (A' |- !p1...pn. s ==> !q1...qm. t)
     A ?- ?w1...wp. s'
}
\noindent where {w1}, ..., {wp} are (type instances of) those pairs among
{p1}, ..., {pn} having variables that do not occur free in {t}.
Note that this is not a valid tactic unless {A'} is a subset of {A}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is an (optionally paired universally quantified)
implication whose consequent can be instantiated to match the goal.
The generalized pairs {u1}, ..., {ui} must occur in {s'} in order for the
conclusion {t} of the supplied theorem to match {t'}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

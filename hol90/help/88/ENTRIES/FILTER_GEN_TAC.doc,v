@\DOC FILTER_GEN_TAC

\TYPE {FILTER_GEN_TAC : (term -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Strips off a universal quantifier, but fails for a given quantified variable.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, selective, quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term {s} and a goal {A ?- !x. t}, the tactic {FILTER_GEN_TAC}
fails if the quantified variable {x} is the same as {s}, but otherwise
advances the goal in the same way as {GEN_TAC}, i.e. returns the goal
{A ?- t[x'/x]} where {x'} is a variant of {x} chosen to avoid clashing with
any variables free in the goal's assumption list. Normally {x'} is just {x}.
{
     A ?- !x. t
   ==============  FILTER_GEN_TAC "s"
    A ?- t[x'/x]
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the goal's conclusion is not universally quantified or the
quantified variable is equal to the given term.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC ASM_REWRITE_TAC

\TYPE {ASM_REWRITE_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Rewrites a goal including built-in rewrites and the goal's assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
{ASM_REWRITE_TAC} generates rewrites with the tautologies in {basic_rewrites},
the set of assumptions, and a list of theorems supplied by the user. These are
applied top-down and recursively on the goal, until no more matches are found.
The order in which the set of rewrite equations is applied is an implementation
matter and the user should not depend on any ordering. Rewriting strategies are
described in more detail under {GEN_REWRITE_TAC}. For omitting the common
tautologies, see the tactic {PURE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC}. To rewrite with only a
subset of the assumptions use {FILTER_ASM_REWRITE_TAC}.

\FAILURE
{ASM_REWRITE_TAC} does not fail, but it can diverge in certain
situations. For rewriting to a limited depth, see
{ONCE_ASM_REWRITE_TAC}. The resulting tactic may not be valid if the
applicable replacement introduces new assumptions into the theorem
eventually proved.

\EXAMPLE
The use of assumptions in rewriting, specially when they are not in an
obvious equational form, is illustrated below:
{
   - let val asm = [Parse.term_parser `(P:'a->bool) x`]
         val goal = Parse.term_parser `(P:'a->bool) x = (Q:'a -> bool) x`
     in
     ASM_REWRITE_TAC[](asm, goal)
     end;

   val it = ([([--`P x`--], --`Q x`--)], fn) : tactic_result

   - let val asm = [Parse.term_parser `~(P:'a->bool) x`]
         val goal = Parse.term_parser `(P:'a->bool) x = (Q:'a -> bool) x`
     in
     ASM_REWRITE_TAC[](asm, goal)
     end;

   val it = ([([--`~P x`--], --`~Q x`--)], fn) : tactic_result
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

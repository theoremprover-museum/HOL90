\DOC FRONT_CONJ_CONV

\TYPE {FRONT_CONJ_CONV: (term list -> term -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a specified conjunct to the beginning of a conjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, conjunction, associative, commutative.

\DESCRIBE
Given a list of boolean terms {[t1;...;t;...;tn]} and a term {t} which occurs
in the list, {FRONT_CONJ_CONV} returns:
{
   |- (t1 /\ ... /\ t /\ ... /\ tn) = (t /\ t1 /\ ... /\ tn)
}
\noindent That is, {FRONT_CONJ_CONV} proves that {t} can be moved to the
`front' of a conjunction of several terms.

\FAILURE
{FRONT_CONJ_CONV ["t1";...;"tn"] "t"} fails if {t} does not occur in the list
{[t1,...,tn]} or if any of {t1}, ..., {tn} do not have type {bool}.

\COMMENTS
This is not a true conversion, so perhaps it ought to be called something else.
The system shows its type as {(term list -> conv)}.

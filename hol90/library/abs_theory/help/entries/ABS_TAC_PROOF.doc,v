@\DOC ABS_TAC_PROOF

\TYPE{ABS_TAC_PROOF : ((goal # tactic) -> thm)}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to prove an abstract goal using a given tactic.

\DESCRIBE 

When applied to a goal-tactic pair {(A ?- t,tac)}, {ABS_TAC_PROOF}
attempts to prove the goal {A ?- t}, using the tactic {tac}. Before
the proof of {A ?- t} is attempted, the theory obligations for each
abstract object used in the goal are added to the assumption list.  If the
proof succeeds, it returns the theorem {A' |- t} corresponding to the
goal, where the assumption list {A'} may be a proper superset of {A}
unless the tactic is valid; there is no inbuilt validity checking.

\FAILURE
Fails if appropriate theory obligations cannot be found.
Fails unless the goal has hypotheses and conclusions all of type {bool},
and the tactic can solve the goal.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DOC list_mk_imp

\TYPE {list_mk_imp : (goal -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively constructs implications.

\DESCRIBE
{list_mk_imp(["t1";...;"tn"],"t")} returns {"t1 ==> ( ... (tn ==> t)...)"}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {list_mk_imp} if any of {t1},...,{tn} are not of type {":bool"} or
if the list of terms is non-empty and {t} is not of type {":bool"}. If the
list of terms is empty the type of {t} can be anything.

\EXAMPLE
{
#list_mk_imp (["T";"F"],"T");;
"T ==> F ==> T" : term

#list_mk_imp (["T";"1"],"T");;
evaluation failed     list_mk_imp

#list_mk_imp (["T";"F"],"1");;
evaluation failed     list_mk_imp

#list_mk_imp ([],"1");;
"1" : term
}

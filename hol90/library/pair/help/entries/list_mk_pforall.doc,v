@\DOC list_mk_pforall

\TYPE {list_mk_pforall : ((term list # term) -> term)}

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively constructs a paired universal quantification.

\DESCRIBE
{list_mk_pforall(["p1";...;"pn"],"t")} returns {"!p1 ... pn. t"}.

\FAILURE
Fails with {list_mk_pforall} if the terms in the list are not paired structures
of variables or if {t} is not of type {":bool"} and the list of terms is 
nonempty.
If the list of terms is empty the type of {t} can be anything.

\COMMENTS
The system shows the type as {(goal -> term)}.

\SEEALSO
list_mk_forall, strip_pforall, mk_pforall.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

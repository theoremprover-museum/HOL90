@\DOC INSERT_CONV

\TYPE {INSERT_CONV : conv -> conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Reduce {x INSERT {{x1,...,x,...,xn}}} to {{{x1,...,x,...,xn}}}.

\LIBRARY pred_sets

\DESCRIBE 
The function {INSERT_CONV} is a parameterized conversion for reducing finite
sets of the form {"t INSERT {{t1,...,tn}}"}, where {{{t1,...,tn}}} is a set of
type {ty->bool} and {t} is equal to some element {ti} of this set.  The first
argument to {INSERT_CONV} is expected to be a conversion that decides equality
between values of the base type {ty}.  Given an equation {"e1 = e2"}, where
{e1} and {e2} are terms of type {ty}, this conversion should return the theorem
{|- (e1 = e2) = T} or the theorem {|- (e1 = e2) = F}, as appropriate.

Given such a conversion, the function {INSERT_CONV} returns a conversion that
maps a term of the form {"t INSERT {{t1,...,tn}}"} to the theorem
{
   |- t INSERT {{t1,...,tn}} = {{t1,...,tn}}
}
\noindent if {t} is alpha-equivalent to any {ti} in the set {{{t1,...,tn}}}, or
if the supplied conversion proves {|- (t = ti) = T} for any {ti}.

\EXAMPLE
In the following example, the conversion {num_EQ_CONV} is supplied as a
parameter and used to test equality of the inserted value {2} with the
remaining elements of the set.
{
   #INSERT_CONV num_EQ_CONV "2 INSERT {{1,SUC 1,3}}";;
   |- {{2,1,SUC 1,3}} = {{1,SUC 1,3}}
}
\noindent In this example, the supplied conversion {num_EQ_CONV} is able to
prove that {2} is equal to {SUC 1} and the set is therefore reduced.  Note
that {"2 INSERT {{1,SUC 1,3}}"} is just {"{{2,1,SUC 1,3}}"}.

A call to {INSERT_CONV} fails when the value being inserted is provably not
equal to any of the remaining elements:
{
   #INSERT_CONV num_EQ_CONV "1 INSERT {{2,3}}";;
   evaluation failed     INSERT_CONV
}
\noindent But this failure can, if desired, be caught using {TRY_CONV}.

The behaviour of the supplied conversion is irrelevant when the inserted value
is alpha-equivalent to one of the remaining elements:
{
   #INSERT_CONV NO_CONV "(y:*) INSERT {{x,y,z}}";;
   |- {{y,x,y,z}} = {{x,y,z}}
}

\noindent The conversion {NO_CONV} always fails, but {INSERT_CONV} is
nontheless able in this case to prove the required result.  

Note that {DEPTH_CONV(INSERT_CONV conv)} can be used to remove duplicate
elements from a finite set, but the following conversion is faster:
{
   #letrec REDUCE_CONV conv tm =
      (SUB_CONV (REDUCE_CONV conv) THENC (TRY_CONV (INSERT_CONV conv))) tm;;
   REDUCE_CONV = - : (conv -> conv)

   #REDUCE_CONV num_EQ_CONV "{{1,2,1,3,2,4,3,5,6}}";;
   |- {{1,2,1,3,2,4,3,5,6}} = {{1,2,4,3,5,6}}
}

\FAILURE 
{INSERT_CONV conv} fails if applied to a term not of the form
{"t INSERT {{t1,...,tn}}"}.  A call {INSERT_CONV conv "t INSERT {{t1,...,tn}}"}
fails unless {t} is alpha-equivalent to some {ti}, or {conv "t = ti"} returns
{|- (t = ti) = T} for some {ti}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

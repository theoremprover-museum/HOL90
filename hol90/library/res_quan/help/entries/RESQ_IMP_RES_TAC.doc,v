@\DOC RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC

\TYPE {RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly resolves a restricted universally quantified theorem with
the assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, resolution, restricted quantification.

\DESCRIBE
The function {RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC} performs repeatedly
resolution using a restricted quantified theorem.
It takes a restricted quantified theorem and transforms it into an
implication. This resulting theorem is used in the resolution.

Given a theorem {th}, the theorem-tactic {RESQ_IMP_RES_TAC}
applies {RESQ_IMP_RES_THEN} repeatedly to resolve the theorem with the
assumptions. 

\FAILURE
Never fails

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

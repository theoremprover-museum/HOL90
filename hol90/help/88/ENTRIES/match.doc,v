\TYPE {match : (term -> term -> ((term # term) list # (type # type) list))}

\SYNOPSIS
Finds instantiations to match one term to another.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to two terms, with no outer quantifiers in the first, {match}
attempts to find a set of type and term instantiations for the first term
(only) to make it match the second. If it succeeds, it returns the
instantiations in the form of a pair containing a list of term instantiations
and a list of type instantiations. If the first term represents the conclusion
of a theorem, the returned instantiations are of the appropriate form to be
passed to {INST_TY_TERM}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the term cannot be matched by one-way instantiation.

\EXAMPLE
The following shows how {match} could be used to match the conclusion of a
theorem to a term.
{
   #let th = REFL "x:*";;
   th = |- x = x

   #match (concl th) "1 = 1";;
   ([("1", "x")], [(":num", ":*")])
   : ((term # term) list # (type # type) list)

   #INST_TY_TERM it th;;
   |- 1 = 1
}
\COMMENTS
Note that there is no guarantee that the returned instantiations will be
possible for {INST_TY_TERM} to achieve, because some of the variables (term or
type) which need to be instantiated may be free in the assumptions, eg:
{
   #top_print print_all_thm;;
   - : (thm -> void)

   #let th = ASSUME "x:* = x";;
   th = x = x |- x = x

   #match (concl th) "1 = 1";;
   ([("1", "x")], [(":num", ":*")])
   : ((term # term) list # (type # type) list)

   #INST_TY_TERM it th;;
   evaluation failed     INST_TYPE: type variable free in assumptions
}
\noindent In fact, for instantiating a theorem, {PART_MATCH} is usually easier.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

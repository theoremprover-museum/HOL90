\TYPE {MATCH_MP_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Reduces the goal using a supplied implication, with matching.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, modus ponens, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem of the form
{
   A' |- !x1...xn. s ==> !y1...ym. t
}
\noindent {MATCH_MP_TAC} produces a tactic that reduces a goal whose conclusion
{t'} is a substitution and/or type instance of {t} to the corresponding
instance of {s}. Any variables free in {s} but not in {t} will be existentially
quantified in the resulting subgoal:
{
     A ?- !v1...vi. t'
  ======================  MATCH_MP_TAC (A' |- !x1...xn. s ==> !y1...tm. t)
     A ?- ?z1...zp. s'
}
\noindent where {z1}, ..., {zp} are (type instances of) those variables among
{x1}, ..., {xn} that do not occur free in {t}. Note that this is not a valid
tactic unless {A'} is a subset of {A}.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is an (optionally universally quantified) implication
whose consequent can be instantiated to match the goal. The generalized
variables {v1}, ..., {vi} must occur in {s'} in order for the conclusion {t} of
the supplied theorem to match {t'}.

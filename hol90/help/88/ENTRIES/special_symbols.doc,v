@\DOC special_symbols

\TYPE {special_symbols : (void -> string list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns a list of special symbols.

\DESCRIBE
An identifier, at the ML or object level, is either alphanumeric, e.g. {true}
or {T}, or consists of a special symbol which starts with a non-alphanumeric
character, e.g. {==>} or {+}. It is a consequence of the non-backtracking
implementation of lexical analysis that any (non-null) initial segment of a
special symbol is also a special symbol, so from the above we know that {==}
and {=} are. The function {special_symbols} returns a list of special symbols;
all non-null initial prefixes of them are also special symbols.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\SEEALSO

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

@\DOC PWORDLEN_bitop_CONV

\TYPE {PWORDLEN_bitop_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, word.

\LIBRARY word

\SYNOPSIS
Computes by inference the predicate asserting the size of a word.

\DESCRIBE
For a term {tm} of type {:(bool)word} involving only a combination of bitwise
operators {WNOT}, {WAND}, {WOR}, {WXOR} and variables, the
result of evaluating 
{
   PWORDLEN_bitop_CONV  "PWORDLEN n tm"
}
\noindent is the theorem
{
   ..., PWORDLEN n vi, ... |- PWORDLEN n tm = T
}
\noindent Each free variable occurred in {tm} will have a corresponding
clause in the assumption. This conversion recursively descends into
the subterms of {tm} until it reaches all simple variables.

\FAILURE
{PWORDLEN_bitop_CONV tm} fails if constants other than those mentioned
above occur in {tm}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {UNFOLD_CONV : (thm list -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Expands sub-components of a hardware description using their definitions.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{UNFOLD_CONV thl "t1 /\ ... /\ tn"} returns a theorem of the form:
{
   B |- t1 /\ ... /\ tn = t1' /\ ... /\ tn'
}
\noindent where each {ti'} is the result of rewriting {ti} with the theorems in
{thl}. The set of assumptions {B} is the union of the instantiated assumptions
of the theorems used for rewriting. If none of the rewrites are applicable to
a {ti}, it is unchanged.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#UNFOLD_CONV [ASSUME "!in out. INV (in,out) = !(t:num). out t = ~(in t)"]
# "INV (l1,l2) /\ INV (l2,l3) /\ (!(t:num). l1 t = l2 (t-1) \/ l3 (t-1))";;
. |- INV(l1,l2) /\ INV(l2,l3) /\ (!t. l1 t = l2(t - 1) \/ l3(t - 1)) =
     (!t. l2 t = ~l1 t) /\
     (!t. l3 t = ~l2 t) /\
     (!t. l1 t = l2(t - 1) \/ l3(t - 1))

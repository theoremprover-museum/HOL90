\TYPE {PSELECT_INTRO : (thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces an epsilon term.

\DESCRIBE
{PSELECT_INTRO} takes a theorem with an applicative conclusion, say
{P x}, and returns a theorem with the epsilon term {$@ P} in place
of the original operand {x}.
{
     A |- P x
   --------------  PSELECT_INTRO
    A |- P($@ P)
}
\noindent The returned theorem asserts that {$@ P} denotes some value
at which {P} holds.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an application.

\COMMENTS
This function is exactly the same as {SELECT_INTRO}, it is duplicated in
the pair library for completeness.

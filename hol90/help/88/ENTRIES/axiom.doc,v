@\DOC axiom

\TYPE {axiom : (string -> string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads an axiom from a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call of {axiom `thy` `ax`} returns axiom {ax} from the theory segment {thy}.
The theory segment {thy} must be part of the current theory. The name {ax} is
the name given to the axiom by the user when it was originally added to the
theory segment (by a call to {new_axiom}).  The name of the current theory
segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {axiom `thy` `ax`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not part
of the current theory. It will fail if there does not exist an axiom of name
{ax} in theory segment {thy}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#axiom `bool` `BOOL_CASES_AX`;;
|- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F)
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

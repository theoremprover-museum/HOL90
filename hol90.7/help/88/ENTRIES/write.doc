\TYPE {write : ((string # string) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Writes characters to a file.

\KEYWORDS
file.

\DESCRIBE
The call {write(port,`characters`)}, where {characters} is a string of
characters to write, and {port} is a string describing a port (a port is the
standard ML file descriptor, normally obtained from a call to {openw} or
{append_openw}), will write the given characters to the file corresponding to
the port.

\FAILURE
May fail or hang in system-dependent ways when given an invalid port
descriptor.

\EXAMPLE
The following assumes that HOL is being run under Unix. It will overwrite any
existing file {test-file} in the current directory. Notice that the actual
string returned by {openw} may vary on other systems.
{
   #let port = openw `test-file`;;
   port = `%test-file` : string

   #write(port,`Hello world`);;
   () : void

   #close port;;
   () : void

   #system `cat test-file`;;
   Hello world0 : int
}

\SYNOPSIS
Assumes a theorem, with existentially quantified pair replaced by a given
witness.

\DESCRIBE
{P_PCHOOSE_TAC} expects a pair {q} and theorem with a paired existentially
quantified conclusion.  When applied to a goal, it adds a new
assumption obtained by introducing the pair {q} as a witness for
the pair {p} whose existence is asserted in the theorem.

    A u {{u[q/p]}} ?- t         ("y" not free anywhere)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem's conclusion is not a paired existential quantification,
or if the first argument is not a paired structure of variables.  
Failures may arise in the tactic-generating function.  
An invalid tactic is produced if the introduced variable is free in {u} or {t},
or if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not alpha-convertible to an 
assumption of the goal.

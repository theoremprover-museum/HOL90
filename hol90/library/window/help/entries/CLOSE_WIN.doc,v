@\DOC CLOSE_WIN

\TYPE {CLOSE_WIN : (win_stack -> win_stack)}

\SYNOPSIS
Pop the top window from the stack and transform the parent window.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{CLOSE_WIN} removes the top window from a window stack and uses the
theorem in that window to transform the parent window. {CLOSE_WIN} is
used to close subwindows opened by the {OPEN_WIN}, {OPEN_CONTEXT} and
{ESTABLISH} commands.

\FAILURE
{CLOSE_WIN} will fail if the stack is empty or is only one window
deep. Other possible failures depend on the command used to open the
window.

\EXAMPLE
{
   - BEGIN_STACK "example" (--`($<==) (A /\ (B /\ F))`--) [] [];
   
   <== * A /\ B /\ F
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (OPEN_WIN [RAND]);
   
       ! A
   <== * B /\ F
   val it = () : unit
   - DO (REWRITE_WIN []);
   
       ! A
   <== * F
   val it = () : unit
   - DO CLOSE_WIN;
   
   <== * A /\ F
   val it = () : unit
   - END_STACK "example";
   val it = () : unit
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

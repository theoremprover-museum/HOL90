@\DOC RULE_ASSUM_TAC

\TYPE {RULE_ASSUM_TAC : ((thm -> thm) -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Maps an inference rule over the assumptions of a goal.

\KEYWORDS
tactic, assumption, rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to an inference rule {f} and a goal {({{A1;...;An}} ?- t)},
the {RULE_ASSUM_TAC} tactical applies the inference rule to each of the
{ASSUME}d assumptions to give a new goal.
{
             {{A1,...,An}} ?- t
   ====================================  RULE_ASSUM_TAC f
    {{f(A1 |- A1),...,f(An |- An)}} ?- t
}
\FAILURE
The application of {RULE_ASSUM_TAC f} to a goal fails iff {f} fails when
applied to any of the assumptions of the goal.

\COMMENTS
It does not matter if the goal has no assumptions, but in this case
{RULE_ASSUM_TAC} has no effect.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {definitions : (string -> (string # thm) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the constant definitions, type definitions and constant specifications
of a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call of {definitions `thy`} returns the definitions of the theory segment
{thy} together with their names. Constant definitions, type definitions and
constant specifications are all retrieved by the function {definitions}. The
theory segment {thy} must be part of the current theory. The names are those
given to the definitions by the user when they were originally added to the
theory segment (by a call, for example, to {new_definition}). The name of the
current theory segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {definitions `thy`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not
part of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#definitions `combin`;;
[(`I_DEF`, |- I = S K K);
 (`S_DEF`, |- S = (\f g x. f x(g x)));
 (`K_DEF`, |- K = (\x y. x));
 (`o_DEF`, |- !f g. f o g = (\x. f(g x)))]
: (string # thm) list
}

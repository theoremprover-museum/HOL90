\TYPE {basic_rewrites: thm list}

\SYNOPSIS
Contains a number of built-in tautologies used, by default, in rewriting.

\DESCRIBE
The variable {basic_rewrites} contains polymorphic tautologies which
are often used for simplifying and solving a goal through rewriting.
They include the clause for reflexivity:
{
   |- !x. (x = x) = T;
}
\noindent as well as rules to reason about equality:
{
   |- !t.
      ((T = t) = t) /\ ((t = T) = t) /\ ((F = t) = ~t) /\ ((t = F) = ~t);
}
Negations are manipulated by the following clauses:
{
   |- (!t. ~~t = t) /\ (~T = F) /\ (~F = T);
}
The set of tautologies includes truth tables for conjunctions,
disjunctions, and implications:
{
   |- !t.
       (T /\ t = t) /\
       (t /\ T = t) /\
       (F /\ t = F) /\
       (t /\ F = F) /\
       (t /\ t = t);
   |- !t.
       (T \/ t = T) /\
       (t \/ T = T) /\
       (F \/ t = t) /\
       (t \/ F = t) /\
       (t \/ t = t);
   |- !t.
       (T ==> t = t) /\
       (t ==> T = T) /\
       (F ==> t = T) /\
       (t ==> t = T) /\
       (t ==> F = ~t);
}
Simple rules for reasoning about conditionals are given by:
{
   |- !t1 t2. ((T => t1 | t2) = t1) /\ ((F => t1 | t2) = t2);
}
Rewriting with the following tautologies allows simplification of
universally and existentially quantified variables and abstractions:
{
   |- !t. (!x. t) = t;
   |- !t. (?x. t) = t;
   |- !t1 t2. (\x. t1)t2 = t1;
}
The list {basic_rewrites} also includes rules for reasoning about
pairs in HOL:
{
   |- !x. FST x,SND x = x;
   |- !x y. FST(x,y) = x;
   |- !x y. SND(x,y) = y]
}
\USES
The {basic_rewrites} are included in the set of equations used by some
of the rewriting tools.

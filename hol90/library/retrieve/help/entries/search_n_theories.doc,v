\TYPE {search_n_theories : (int -> searchstep -> searchstep)}

\SYNOPSIS
Function to continue a search for a specified number of steps.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
{search_n_theories} continues a search for a specified number of steps or
until there are no more steps to be performed. It takes an integer and a step
of a search as arguments, and returns a new step.

\FAILURE
The function may fail for a number of obscure reasons. Since the user may
supply his/her own side-condition functions at the beginning of the search, an
exhaustive list of possible failures cannot be given.

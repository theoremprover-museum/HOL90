\DOC UNDISCH_ALL

\TYPE {UNDISCH_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively undischarges antecedents in a chain of implications.

\KEYWORDS
rule, undischarge, antecedent.

\DESCRIBE
{
    A |- t1 ==> ... ==> tn ==> t
   ------------------------------  UNDISCH_ALL
        A, t1, ..., tn |- t
}
\noindent Note that {UNDISCH_ALL} treats {"~u"} as {"u ==> F"}.

\FAILURE
Unlike {UNDISCH}, {UNDISCH_ALL} will,
when called on something other than an implication or negation,
return its argument unchanged rather than failing.

\COMMENTS
Identical terms which are repeated in {A, "t1", ..., "tn"} will
not be duplicated in the hypotheses of the resulting theorem.
However, if two or more alpha-equivalent terms appear in {A, "t1", ..., "tn"},
then each distinct term will appear in the result.

@\DOC DISCARD_TAC

\TYPE {DISCARD_TAC : thm_tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Discards a theorem already present in a goal's assumptions.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A' |- s} and a goal, {DISCARD_TAC}
checks that {s} is simply {T} (true), or already exists (up
to alpha-conversion) in the assumption list of the goal. In
either case, the tactic has no effect. Otherwise, it fails.
{
    A ?- t
   ========  DISCARD_TAC (A' |- s)
    A ?- t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the above conditions are not met, i.e. the theorem's conclusion
is not {T} or already in the assumption list (up to alpha-conversion).

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

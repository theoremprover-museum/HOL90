@\DOC print_all_thm

\TYPE {print_all_thm : (thm -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Prints a theorem in full.

\DESCRIBE
The function {print_all_thm} will cause the system to print a
theorem with its hypotheses.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
As a simple example of the use of {print_all_thm} we assume the
following two theorems:
{
   #let a = ASSUME "A:bool";;
   a = . |- A
}
{
   #let b = ASSUME "A ==> B";;
   b = . |- A ==> B
}
\noindent Using Modus Ponens (MP) as follows:
{
   #let r = MP b a;;
}
\noindent The system responds with:
{
   r = .. |- B
}
\noindent By using {print_all_thm} as follows:
{
   #print_all_thm r;;
}
\noindent The system then pretty prints:
{
   A ==> B, A |- B() : void
}
\noindent This shows all the assumptions of the theorem in a comma separated
list.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {new_constant : {{Name :string, Ty :hol_type}} -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares a new constant in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_constant{{Name="c", Ty = ty}}} makes {c} a constant in the current
theory. Note that it does not specify its value. The constant may have a 
polymorphic type, which can be used in arbitrary instantiations.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode, or if the name is not a valid constant
name, or there is already a constant of that name in the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
   - new_theory "zonk";
   () : unit

   - new_constant{{Name = "graham's_number", Ty = ==`:num`==}};
   () : unit
}

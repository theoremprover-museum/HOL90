@\DOC LIST_CONJ

\TYPE {LIST_CONJ : (thm list -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Conjoins the conclusions of a list of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
rule, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{
         A1 |- t1 ... An |- tn
   ----------------------------------  LIST_CONJ
    A1 u ... u An |- t1 /\ ... /\ tn
}
\FAILURE
{LIST_CONJ} will fail with {`end_itlist`} if applied to an empty list
of theorems.

\COMMENTS
The system shows the type as {proof}.

{LIST_CONJ} does not check for alpha-equivalence of assumptions when forming
their union. If a particular assumption is duplicated within one of the input
theorems assumption lists, then it may be duplicated in the resulting
assumption list.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

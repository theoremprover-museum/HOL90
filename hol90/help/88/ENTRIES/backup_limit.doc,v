@\DOC backup_limit

\TYPE {backup_limit : int}

\SYNOPSIS
Limits the number of proof states saved on the subgoal package backup list.

\DESCRIBE
The assignable variable {backup_limit} is initially set to 12. Its value is one
less than the maximum number of proof states that may be saved on the backup
list. Adding a new proof state (by, for example, a call to {expand}) after the
maximum is reached causes the earliest proof state on the list to be discarded.
For a description of the subgoal package, see  {set_goal}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#backup_limit := 0;;
0 : int

#g "(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])";;
"(HD[1;2;3] = 1) /\ (TL[1;2;3] = [2;3])"

() : void

#e CONJ_TAC;;
OK..
2 subgoals
"TL[1;2;3] = [2;3]"

"HD[1;2;3] = 1"

() : void

#e (REWRITE_TAC[HD]);;
OK..

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

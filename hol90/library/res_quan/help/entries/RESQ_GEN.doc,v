@\DOC RESQ_GEN

\TYPE {RESQ_GEN : ((term # term) -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generalizes the conclusion of a theorem to a restricted universal quantification.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier, universal.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms {x}, {P} and a theorem {A |- t},
the inference rule {RESQ_GEN} returns the theorem {A |- !x::P. t},
provided that {P} is a predicate taking an argument of the same type
as {x} and that {x} is a variable not free in any of the assumptions
except {P x} if it occurs. There is no compulsion that {x} should
be free in {t} or {P x} should be in the assumptions.
{
      A |- t
   --------------- RESQ_GEN ("x","P") [where x is not free in A except P x]
    A |- !x::P. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails if {x} is not a variable, or if it is free in any of the assumptions
other than {P x}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

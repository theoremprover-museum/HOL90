1.1
log
@First phase of hol90.8 development.  hol90 now compiles using NJSML-CM
108.5, with separate compilation of libraries.  System dependencies
have been isolated in the makefiles and "portable.sml".

This involved a large number of enhancments to the source files,
most of which are documented in the 7.changes file (or will be shortly).
See also the correpsonding email corrspondence between RJB, KLS, TFM,
JRH and DRS that happened during this development.

@(*========================================================================
 * ld_BASIC_HOL.sml
 *
 * Loader file for the BASIC_HOL theory.  Could be remade automatically.
 *
 * The idea of this file is that if a structure depends
 * on having the BASIC_HOL theory loaded, then it should go "open BASIC_HOL"
 * at the top of the structure.  A compilation manager like CM will
 * then tell that this file needs to be laoded first.  This is the
 * only way of expressing such a dependency in CM.
 *
 * It may be better if each theory in BASIC_HOL had its
 * own structure.  Then a structure utilising one of the theories would
 * have "open Pair" or "open Num" in its header.   The dependencies are 
 * thus recorded at a finer grain.  But it hardly seems worth it.
 *
 * In the future the signature of this structure may be expanded to
 * include structures for the theories that are in BASIC_HOL. 
 *
 * This file may be loaded multiple times without detriment.
 *======================================================================*)

@\DOC set_help

\TYPE {set_help : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specifies a filter to pipe help output through.

\DESCRIBE
Evaluating {set_help `filter`} will make future help output (generated in
response to a {help} command) be piped through the program {filter}. The
function returns the name of the previous filter. The default is {cat}, so
output is just sent to the console. Previous versions of HOL used {more} by
default.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
{
#set_help `lpr`;;
`cat` : string
}
\noindent This causes the help file to be printed instead of being displayed.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

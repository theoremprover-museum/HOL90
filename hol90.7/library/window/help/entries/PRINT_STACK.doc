\TYPE {PRINT_WIN : (unit -> unit)}

\SYNOPSIS
Print out the top window of the current window stack.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{PRINT_STACK} will print out the top window on the stack according to
the following format.
{
     ! "a"
     | "l"
     ? "c"
     $ "u"
     @ "b"
   R * "f"
}
That is, {PRINT_STACK} prints the context of the window followed by
{R * "f"} where {R} is the relation that the window is supposed to
preserve, and {"f"} is the focus of the window. Each element in the
context is preceded by some prefix.
The prefix {!} denotes an assumption.
The prefix {|} denotes a lemma.
The prefix {?} denotes a conjecture.
The prefix {$} denotes a used conjecture.
The prefix {@} denotes a bad conjecture.

\FAILURE
{PRINT_STACK ()} will fail if there is no current window stack.

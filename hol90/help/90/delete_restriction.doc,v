@\DOC delete_restriction

\TYPE {delete_restriction : (string -> unit)}

\SYNOPSIS
Removes a restriction semantics from a binder.

\DESCRIBE
Recall that if {B} is a binder and {RES_B} a constant then
{
   associate_restriction("B", "RES_B")
}
\noindent will cause the parser and pretty-printer to support:
{
               ---- parse ---->
   Bv::P. B                       RES_B  P (\v. B)
              <---- print ----
}
This behaviour may be disabled by calling {delete_restriction} with 
the binder name ("B" in this example).

\FAILURE
Fails if you attempt to remove one of the builtin restrictions. These are 
associated with the binders
{
  ["!","?","@@","\\"]
}
Also fails if the named binder is not restricted, i.e., found as the first 
member of a pair on the list returned by {binder_restrictions}.

\EXAMPLE
{
    associate_restriction("DURING","RES_DURING");
    () : unit

    --`DURING x::(m,n). p x`--;
    (--`DURING x ::(m,n). p x`--) : term

    - delete_restriction "DURING";
    () : unit

    --`DURING x::(m,n). p x`--;

    Exception raised at Parse_support.restr_binder:
    no restriction associated with "DURING"
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

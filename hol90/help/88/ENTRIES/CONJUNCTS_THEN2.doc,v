@\DOC CONJUNCTS_THEN2

\TYPE {CONJUNCTS_THEN2 : (thm_tactic -> thm_tactic -> thm_tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies two theorem-tactics to the corresponding conjuncts of a theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{CONJUNCTS_THEN2} takes two theorem-tactics, {f1} and {f2}, and a theorem {t}
whose conclusion must be a conjunction. {CONJUNCTS_THEN2} breaks {t} into two
new theorems, {t1} and {t2} which are {CONJUNCT1} and {CONJUNCT2} of {t}
respectively, and then returns the tactic {f1 t1 THEN f2 t2}. Thus
{
   CONJUNCTS_THEN2 f1 f2 (A |- l /\ r) =  f1 (A |- l) THEN f2 (A |- r)
}
\noindent so if
{
   A1 ?- t1                     A2 ?- t2
  ==========  f1 (A |- l)      ==========  f2 (A |- r)
   A2 ?- t2                     A3 ?- t3
}
\noindent then
{
    A1 ?- t1
   ==========  CONJUNCTS_THEN2 f1 f2 (A |- l /\ r)
    A3 ?- t3
}
\FAILURE
{CONJUNCTS_THEN f} will fail if applied to a theorem whose conclusion is not a
conjunction.

\COMMENTS
The system shows the type as {(thm_tactic -> thm_tactical)}.

\USES
The construction of complex {tactical}s like {CONJUNCTS_THEN}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

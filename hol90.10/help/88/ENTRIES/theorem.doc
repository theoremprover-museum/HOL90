\DOC theorem

\TYPE {theorem : (string -> string -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Reads a derived theorem from a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call of {theorem `thy` `th`} returns the theorem named {th} from the
theory segment {thy}. The theory segment {thy} must be part of the current
theory. The name {th} is the name given to the theorem by the user when it
was originally added to the theory segment (by, for example, a call to
{save_thm}). The name of the current theory segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {theorem `thy` `th`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not
part of the current theory.
It will fail if there does not exist a derived theorem {th} in theory
segment {thy}.

\EXAMPLE
{
#theorem `arithmetic` `ADD_SYM`;;
|- !m n. m + n = n + m
}

\DOC append_openw

\TYPE {append_openw : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Opens a port for appending to a named file.

\KEYWORDS
file.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a filename {`name`}, the function {append_openw} opens the file
{name} for writing, such that existing contents are appended to rather than
overwritten. It returns a port descriptor string, which can be used by {write}
to append to the file, and by {close} to close it.

\EXAMPLE
The following example assumes that HOL is being run under Unix. It will
overwrite an existing file {test-file} in the current directory.
{
   #system `echo -n 'Hello ' >test-file`;;
   0 : int

   #let port = append_openw `test-file`;;
   port = `%test-file` : string

   #write(port,`world`);;
   () : void

   #close port;;
   () : void

   #system `cat test-file`;;
   Hello world0 : int
}

@\DOC subst_occs

\TYPE {subst_occs : (int list list -> (term # term) list -> term -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Substitutes for particular occurrences of subterms of a given term.

\DESCRIBE
For each substitution pair {("a_i","b_i")} in the second argument,
there should be a corresponding integer list {l_i} in the first argument
that specifies which free occurrences of {"b_i"} in the third argument should
be substituted by {"a_i"}.

\FAILURE
Failure occurs if any substitution fails, or if the size of
the first argument is not equal to the size of the second argument. In
other words, every substitution pair should be accompanied by a list specifying
when the substitution is applicable.

\EXAMPLE
{
   #subst_occs [[1;3]] [("1","SUC 0")] "SUC 0 + SUC 0 = SUC(SUC 0)";;
   "1 + (SUC 0) = SUC 1" : term

   #subst_occs [[1];[1]] [("1","SUC 0");("2","SUC 1")] "SUC(SUC 0) = SUC 1";;
   "SUC 1 = 2" : term

   #subst_occs
   #[[1];[1]] [("2","SUC(SUC 0)");("1","SUC 0")] "SUC(SUC 0) = SUC 0";;
   "2 = 1" : term
}

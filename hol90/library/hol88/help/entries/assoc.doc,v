\TYPE {Compat.assoc : ''a -> (''a * 'b) list -> ''a * 'b}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches a list of pairs for a pair whose first component equals a specified
value.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
{assoc x [(x1,y1),...,(xn,yn)]} returns the first {(xi,yi)} in the list such
that {xi} equals {x}. The lookup is done on an eqtype, i.e., the SML 
implementation must be able to decide equality for the type of {x}.

\FAILURE
Fails if no matching pair is found. This will always be the case if the list
is empty.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - assoc 2 [(1,4),(3,2),(2,5),(2,6)];
 (2, 5) : (int * int)
}

\COMMENTS
Not found in hol90, since we use an option type instead of exceptions.

    assoc1;
    val it = fn : ''a -> (''a * 'b) list -> (''a * 'b) option
    - assoc2;
    val it = fn : ''a -> ('b * ''a) list -> ('b * ''a) option

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\DESCRIBE
If {m} and {n} are numerals (e.g. {0}, {1}, {2}, {3},...), then
{EXP_CONV "m EXP n"} returns the theorem:
{
   |- m EXP n = s
}
\noindent where {s} is the numeral that denotes the result of raising the
natural number denoted by {m} to the power of the natural number denoted
by {n}.

\FAILURE
{EXP_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} is of the form  {"m EXP n"}, where {m} and
{n} are numerals.

\EXAMPLE
{
#EXP_CONV "0 EXP 0";;
|- 0 EXP 0 = 1

#EXP_CONV "15 EXP 0";;
|- 15 EXP 0 = 1

#EXP_CONV "12 EXP 1";;
|- 12 EXP 1 = 12

#EXP_CONV "2 EXP 6";;
|- 2 EXP 6 = 64
}

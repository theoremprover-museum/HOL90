\TYPE {timer : (bool -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Switches timing and inference-counting on or off.

\DESCRIBE
A call {timer true} switches on timing and inference-counting; {timer false}
switches it off. In either case, the previous on/off setting ({true} means on)
is returned. When switched on, the CPU (and, if relevant, garbage collection)
time and the number of intermediate theorems generated is displayed.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
This example was run from a state with timings initially switched off:
{
   #let th = SPEC "x:num" (theorem `arithmetic` `ADD1`);;
   th = |- SUC x = x + 1
   Run time: 0.0s
   Intermediate theorems generated: 1

   #ONCE_REWRITE_RULE[EQ_SYM_EQ] th;;
   |- x + 1 = SUC x
   Run time: 0.1s
   Intermediate theorems generated: 11

   #SYM th;;
   |- x + 1 = SUC x
   Run time: 0.0s
   Intermediate theorems generated: 1
}
\USES
Guiding the optimization of important proofs.

\COMMENTS
The same effect can be achieved by setting the flag {timing}.

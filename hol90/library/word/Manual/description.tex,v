\chapter{The {\tt word} library}

Bit vector (or word)\footnote{The two terms, {\it bit vector\/} and
{\it word\/} will be used interchangeably in this manual.}  is one of
the fundamental data objects in hardware  
specification and verification. The modelling of bit vectors is a
key to the success of a hardware verification project. This library
attempt to provide a general, flexible infrastructure for reasoning about
words. The description begins with a discussion of approach used
by the library to model words. This is followed by a summary of the
facilities available in the library. Chapter~2 contains the reference
entries of all \ML\ functions, and the last chapter lists all theorems
stored in the library.

@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

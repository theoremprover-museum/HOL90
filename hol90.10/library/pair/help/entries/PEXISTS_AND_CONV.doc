\TYPE {PEXISTS_AND_CONV : conv}

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, conjunction.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a paired existential quantification inwards through a conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {?p. t /\ u}, where variables in {p} are
not free in both {t} and {u}, {PEXISTS_AND_CONV} returns a theorem of one of
three forms, depending on occurrences of variables from {p} in {t} and {u}.  
If {p} contains variables free in {t} but none in {u}, then the theorem:
{
   |- (?p. t /\ u) = (?p. t) /\ u
}
\noindent is returned.  If {p} contains variables free in {u} but none in {t},
then the result is:
{
   |- (?p. t /\ u) = t /\ (?x. u)
}
\noindent And if {p} does not contain any variable free in either {t} nor {u},
then the result is:
{
   |- (?p. t /\ u) = (?x. t) /\ (?x. u)
}
\FAILURE
{PEXISTS_AND_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{?p. t /\ u}, or if it is applied to a term {?p. t /\ u} in which 
variables in {p} are free in both {t} and {u}.

\DOC CONJ_DISCHL

\TYPE {CONJ_DISCHL : (term list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Conjoins multiple assumptions to both sides of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, conjunction, assumption.

\DESCRIBE
Given a term list {[t1;...;tn]} and a theorem whose conclusion is an equation
between boolean terms, {CONJ_DISCHL} conjoins all the terms
in the list to both sides of the equation, and removes any of the terms which
were in the assumption list.

    A - {{t1,...,tn}} |- (t1/\.../\tn/\s) = (t1/\.../\tn/\t)     ["t1";...;"tn"]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem is an equation, both sides of which, and all the terms
provided, are of type {bool}.

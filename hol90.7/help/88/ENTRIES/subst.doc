\TYPE {subst : ((term # term) list -> term -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Substitutes terms in a term.

\DESCRIBE
Given a list of term pairs {[("a_1","b_1"),...,("a_n","b_n")]}
and a term {"c"}, {subst} attempts to substitute  all free occurrences of
{"b_i"} in {"c"} by {"a_i"} for all {i} ranging between {1} and {n}.

\FAILURE
Failure occurs if for some {i} ranging between {1} and {n}, the substitution
of {"b_i"} by {"a_i"} fails.
The substitution of  {"b_i"} by {"a_i"} fails for some {i},
if the types of {"a_i"} and  {"b_i"} are not the same.

\EXAMPLE
{
   #subst [("1","SUC 0")] "SUC(SUC 0)";;
   "SUC 1" : term

   #subst [("1","SUC 0");("2","SUC 1")] "SUC(SUC 0)";;
   "SUC 1" : term

   #subst [("1","SUC 0");("2","SUC 1")] "SUC(SUC 0) = SUC 1";;
   "SUC 1 = 2" : term

   #subst [("b:num","a:num")] "\a:num. (b:num)";;
   "\a. b" : term

   #subst [("foo:*","flip:*")] "waddle:*";;
   "waddle" : term
}

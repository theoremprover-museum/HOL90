\TYPE {new_binder : {{Name :string, Ty :hol_type}} -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Sets up a new binder in the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {new_binder{{Name ="bnd",Ty = ty}}} declares a new binder {bnd} in the 
current theory. The type must be of the form {('a -> 'b) -> 'c}, because
being a binder, {bnd} will apply to an abstraction; for example 

    {--`!x:bool. (x=T) \/ (x=F)`--} 

is actually a prettyprinting of 

    {--`$! (\x. (x=T) \/ (x=F))`--}.

\FAILURE
Fails if HOL is not in draft mode, or there is already a constant of some sort
of that name in the current theory, or if the type does not correspond to the
above pattern.

\EXAMPLE
{
   - new_theory "anorak";
   () : unit

   - new_binder{{Name = "!!", Ty = ==`:(bool->bool)->bool`==}};
   () : unit

   - --`!!x. T`--;
   (--`!! x. T`--) : term
}

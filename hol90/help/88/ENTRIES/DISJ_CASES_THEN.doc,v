@\DOC DISJ_CASES_THEN

\TYPE {DISJ_CASES_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies a theorem-tactic to each disjunct of a disjunctive theorem.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, disjunction, cases.

\DESCRIBE
If the theorem-tactic {f:thm->tactic} applied to either
{ASSUME}d disjunct produces results as follows when applied to a goal
{(A ?- t)}:
{
    A ?- t                                A ?- t
   =========  f (u |- u)      and        =========  f (v |- v)
    A ?- t1                               A ?- t2
}
\noindent then applying {DISJ_CASES_THEN f (|- u \/ v)}
to the goal {(A ?- t)} produces two subgoals.
{
           A ?- t
   ======================  DISJ_CASES_THEN f (|- u \/ v)
    A ?- t1      A ?- t2
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the theorem is not a disjunction.  An invalid tactic is
produced if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not
alpha-convertible to an assumption of the goal.

\EXAMPLE
Given the theorem
{
   th = |- (m = 0) \/ (?n. m = SUC n)
}
\noindent and a goal of the form {?- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0)},
applying the tactic
{
   DISJ_CASES_THEN ASSUME_TAC th
}
\noindent produces two subgoals, each with one disjunct as an added
assumption:
{
   ?n. m = SUC n ?- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0)

   m = 0 ?- (PRE m = m) = (m = 0)
}
\USES
Building cases tactics. For example, {DISJ_CASES_TAC} could be defined by:
{
   let DISJ_CASES_TAC = DISJ_CASES_THEN ASSUME_TAC
}
\COMMENTS
Use {DISJ_CASES_THEN2} to apply different tactic generating functions
to each case.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

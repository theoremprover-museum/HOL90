\TYPE {PTAUT_TAC : tactic}

\SYNOPSIS
Tautology checker. Proves propositional goals.

\LIBRARY taut

\DESCRIBE
Given a goal with a conclusion that contains only Boolean constants,
Boolean-valued variables, Boolean equalities, implications, conjunctions,
disjunctions, negations and Boolean-valued conditionals, this tactic will
prove the goal if it is valid. If all the variables in the conclusion are
universally quantified, this tactic will also reduce an invalid goal to false.

\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the goal is not of the form
{"!x1 ... xn. f[x1,...,xn]"} where {f[x1,...,xn]} is a propositional formula
(except that the variables do not have to be universally quantified if the
goal is valid).

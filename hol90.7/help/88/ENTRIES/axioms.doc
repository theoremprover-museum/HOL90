\TYPE {axioms : (string -> (string # thm) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the axioms of a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call {axioms `thy`} returns the axioms of the theory segment {thy} together
with their names. The theory segment {thy} must be part of the current theory.
The names are those given to the axioms by the user when they were originally
added to the theory segment (by a call to {new_axiom}). The name of the current
theory segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {axioms `thy`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not
part of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#axioms `bool`;;
[(`SELECT_AX`, |- !P x. P x ==> P($@ P));
 (`ETA_AX`, |- !t. (\x. t x) = t);
 (`IMP_ANTISYM_AX`,
  |- !t1 t2. (t1 ==> t2) ==> (t2 ==> t1) ==> (t1 = t2));
 (`BOOL_CASES_AX`, |- !t. (t = T) \/ (t = F));
 (`ARB_THM`, |- $= = $=)]
: (string # thm) list
}

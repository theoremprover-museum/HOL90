\DOC SUBST_TAC

\TYPE {SUBST_TAC : (thm list -> tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Makes term substitutions in a goal using a list of theorems.

\KEYWORDS
tactic.

\DESCRIBE

Given a list of theorems {A1|-u1=v1,...,An|-un=vn} and a goal {(A,t)},
{SUBST_TAC} rewrites the term {t} into the term {t[v1,...,vn/u1,...,un]} by
simultaneously substituting {vi} for each occurrence of {ui} in {t} with {vi}:
{
              A ?- t
   =============================  SUBST_TAC [A1|-u1=v1;...;An|-un=vn]
    A ?- t[v1,...,vn/u1,...,un]
}
\noindent The assumptions of the theorems used to substitute with are not added
to the assumptions {A} of the goal, while they are recorded in the proof.  If
any {Ai} is not a subset of {A} (up to alpha-conversion), then {SUBST_TAC
[A1|-u1=v1;...;An|-un=vn]} results in an invalid tactic.

{SUBST_TAC} automatically renames bound variables to prevent free variables in
{vi} becoming bound after substitution.

\FAILURE
{SUBST_TAC [th1;...;thn] (A,t)} fails if the conclusion of any theorem in the
list is not an equation.  No change is made to the goal if no occurrence of the
left-hand side of the conclusion of {thi} appears in {t}.

\EXAMPLE
When trying to solve the goal
{
   ?- (n + 0) + (0 + m) = m + n
}
\noindent by substituting with the theorems
{
   #let thm1 = SPECL ["m:num"; "n:num"] ADD_SYM
   #and thm2 = CONJUNCT1 ADD_CLAUSES;;
   thm1 = |- m + n = n + m
   thm2 = |- 0 + m = m
}
\noindent applying {SUBST_TAC [thm1; thm2]} results in the goal
{
   ?- (n + 0) + m = n + m
}
\USES
{SUBST_TAC} is used when rewriting (for example, with {REWRITE_TAC}) is
extensive or would diverge.  Substituting is also much faster than rewriting.

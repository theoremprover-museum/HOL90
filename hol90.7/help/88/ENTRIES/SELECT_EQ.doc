\DOC SELECT_EQ

\TYPE {SELECT_EQ : (term -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies epsilon abstraction to both terms of an equation.

\KEYWORDS
rule, epsilon, equality.

\DESCRIBE
Effects the extensionality of the epsilon operator {@}.
{
       A |- t1 = t2
   ------------------------  SELECT_EQ "x"      [where x is not free in A]
    A |- (@x.t1) = (@x.t2)
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the conclusion of the theorem is not an equation, or if the
variable {x} is free in {A}.

\EXAMPLE
Given a theorem which shows the equivalence of two distinct forms of
defining the property of being an even number:
{
   th = |- (x MOD 2 = 0) = (?y. x = 2 * y)
}
\noindent A theorem giving the equivalence of the epsilon abstraction of each
form is obtained:
{
   #SELECT_EQ "x:num" th;;
   |- (@x. x MOD 2 = 0) = (@x. ?y. x = 2 * y)
}

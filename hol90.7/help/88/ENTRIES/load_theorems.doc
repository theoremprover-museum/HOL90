\DOC load_theorems

\TYPE {load_theorems : (string -> void list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads in all the theorems from a given theory.

\DESCRIBE
If {thy} is the name of an ancestor theory, then the call
{
   load_theorems `thy`
}
\noindent attempts to load in all the theorems from that theory, that is, for
each axiom {th}, to perform dynamically the following toplevel binding:
{
  let th = theorem `thy` `th`;;
}

\FAILURE
Fails unless {thy} is an ancestor theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#load_theorems `bool`;;
[(); (); (); (); ()] : void list

PAIR_EQ = |- !x y a b. (x,y = a,b) = (x = a) /\ (y = b)

SND = |- !x y. SND(x,y) = y

FST = |- !x y. FST(x,y) = x

PAIR = |- !x. FST x,SND x = x

PAIR_EXISTS = |- ?p. IS_PAIR p
}

\DOC save_thm

\TYPE {save_thm : ((string # thm) -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Stores a theorem in the current theory segment.

\DESCRIBE
The call {save_thm(`name`, th)} adds the theorem {th} to the current theory
segment under the name {name}. The theorem is returned as a value. The call
can be made in both proof and draft mode. The name {name} must be a distinct
name within the theory segment, but may be the same as for items within other
theory segments of the theory. If the current theory segment is named {thy},
the theorem will be written to the file {thy.th} in the directory from which
HOL was called. If the system is in draft mode, other changes made to the
current theory segment  during the session will also be written to the theory
file. If the theory file does not exist, it will be created.

\FAILURE
A call to {save_thm} will fail if  the name given is the same as
the name of an existing fact in the current theory segment.
Saving the theorem involves writing to the file system. If the write fails for
any reason {save_thm} will fail. For example, on start up the initial
theory is {HOL}. The associated theory files are read-only so an attempt to
save a theorem in that theory segment will fail.

\USES
Adding theorems to the current theory. Saving theorems for retrieval
in  later sessions. The theorem may be retrieved using the function
{theorem}. Binding the result of {save_thm} to an ML variable makes it easy to
access the theorem in the current terminal session.

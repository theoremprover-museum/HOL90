@\DOC PSTRUCT_CASES_TAC

\TYPE {PSTRUCT_CASES_TAC : thm_tactic}

\KEYWORDS
tactic, cases.

\LIBRARY pair 

\SYNOPSIS
Performs very general structural case analysis.

\DESCRIBE
When it is applied to a theorem of the form:
{
   th = A' |- ?p11...p1m. (x=t1) /\ (B11 /\ ... /\ B1k) \/ ... \/
                ?pn1...pnp. (x=tn) /\ (Bn1 /\ ... /\ Bnp)
}
\noindent in which there may be no paired existential quantifiers where a
`vector' of them is shown above, {PSTRUCT_CASES_TAC th} splits a goal
{A ?- s} into {n} subgoals as follows:
{
                             A ?- s
   ===============================================================
    A u {{B11,...,B1k}} ?- s[t1/x] ... A u {{Bn1,...,Bnp}} ?- s[tn/x]
}
\noindent that is, performs a case split over the possible constructions (the
{ti}) of a term, providing as assumptions the given constraints, having
split conjoined constraints into separate assumptions. Note that unless {A'}
is a subset of {A}, this is an invalid tactic.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem has the above form, namely a conjunction of
(possibly multiply paired existentially quantified) terms which assert the
equality of the same variable {x} and the given terms.

\USES
Generating a case split from the axioms specifying a structure.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

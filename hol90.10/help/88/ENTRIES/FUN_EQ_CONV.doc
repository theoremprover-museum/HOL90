\DOC FUN_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {FUN_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Equates normal and extensional equality for two functions.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, extentionality.

\DESCRIBE
The conversion {FUN_EQ_CONV} embodies the fact that two functions are equal
precisely when they give the same results for all values to which they can be
applied. When supplied with a term argument of the form {f = g}, where {f} and
{g} are functions of type {ty1->ty2}, {FUN_EQ_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (f = g) = (!x. f x = g x)
}
\noindent where {x} is a variable of type {ty1} chosen by the conversion.

\FAILURE
{FUN_EQ_CONV tm} fails if {tm} is not an equation {f = g}, where {f} and {g}
are functions.

\USES
Used for proving equality of functions.

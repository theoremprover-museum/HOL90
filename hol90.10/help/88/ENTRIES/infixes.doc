\DOC infixes

\TYPE {infixes : (string -> term list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Lists the infixes in the named theory.

\DESCRIBE
The function {infixes} should be applied to a string which is the name of an
ancestor theory (including the current theory; the special string {`-`} is
always interpreted as the current theory). It returns a list of all the infixes
declared in that theory.

\FAILURE
Fails unless the given theory is an ancestor of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
The theory {HOL} has no infixes:
{
   #infixes `HOL`;;
   [] : term list
}
\noindent but the theory {arithmetic} has several:
{
   #infixes `arithmetic`;;
   ["$DIV"; "$MOD"; "$>="; "$<="; "$>"; "$EXP"; "$*"; "$-"; "$+"]
   : term list
}

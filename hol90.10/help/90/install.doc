\TYPE {Install.install : string -> unit}

\SYNOPSIS
Informs HOL of the absolute pathname to the hol distribution directory.

\DESCRIBE
{install} reconfigures a running HOL system to a new root directory.  The
string argument to {install} should be the absolute path name to the
directory in which the HOL system is located. Executing
{
   install "/dir1/dir2/dir3/.../hol";
}
\noindent resets the HOLdir, help_path, theory_path, and library_path to take
account of the new root directory for the system.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\COMMENTS
The effect persists only for the current HOL session. To change the image
permanently, use the {save_hol} function after calling {install}. The same 
effect can be obtained by the unix shell command {resituate_hol90}.

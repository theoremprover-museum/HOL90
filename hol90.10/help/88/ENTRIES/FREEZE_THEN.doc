\TYPE {FREEZE_THEN : thm_tactical}

\SYNOPSIS
`Freezes' a theorem to prevent instantiation of its free variables.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, selective, free.

\DESCRIBE
{FREEZE_THEN} expects a tactic-generating function {f:thm->tactic}
and a theorem {(A1 |- w)} as arguments.  The tactic-generating function {f}
is applied to the theorem {(w |- w)}.  If this tactic generates the subgoal:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  f (w |- w)
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent then applying {FREEZE_THEN f (A1 |- w)}
to the goal {(A ?- t)} produces the subgoal:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  FREEZE_THEN f (A1 |- w)
    A ?- t1
}
\noindent Since the term {w} is a hypothesis of the argument to the
function {f}, none of the free variables present in {w} may be
instantiated or generalized.  The hypothesis is discharged by
{PROVE_HYP} upon the completion of the proof of the subgoal.

\FAILURE
Failures may arise from the tactic-generating function.  An invalid
tactic arises if the hypotheses of the theorem are not
alpha-convertible to assumptions of the goal.

\EXAMPLE
Given the goal {([ "b < c"; "a < b" ], "(SUC a) <= c")}, and the
specialized variant of the theorem {LESS_TRANS}:
{
   th = |- !p. a < b /\ b < p ==> a < p
}
\noindent {IMP_RES_TAC th} will generate several unneeded assumptions:
{
   {{b < c, a < b, a < c, !p. c < p ==> b < p, !a'. a' < a ==> a' < b}}
       ?- (SUC a) <= c
}
\noindent which can be avoided by first `freezing' the theorem, using
the tactic
{
   FREEZE_THEN IMP_RES_TAC th
}
\noindent This prevents the variables {a} and {b} from being instantiated.
{
   {{b < c, a < b, a < c}} ?- (SUC a) <= c
}
\USES
Used in serious proof hacking to limit the matches achievable by
resolution and rewriting.

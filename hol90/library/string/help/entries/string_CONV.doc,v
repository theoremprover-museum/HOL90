@\DOC string_CONV

\TYPE {string_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Axiom-scheme for character string constants.

\DESCRIBE 
The conversion {string_CONV} expects its term argument to be a non-empty ascii
character string constant (for example: {"`a`"}, {"`b`"}, {"`abc`"}, etc).
Given such a term, for example `abc`, the conversion returns the theorem:
{
   |- `abc` = STRING(ASCII F T T F F F F T)`bc`
}
\noindent where {(ASCII F T T F F F F T)} is the ascii character code for
the first character in the supplied string (in this case {`a`}).

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form shown above or if applied
to the empty string {"``"}.

\SEEALSO
string_EQ_CONV.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

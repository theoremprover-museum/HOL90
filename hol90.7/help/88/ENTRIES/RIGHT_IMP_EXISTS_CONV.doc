\DOC RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV

\TYPE {RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves an existential quantification of the consequent outwards through an
implication.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, existential, implication.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {P ==> (?x.Q)}, the conversion
{RIGHT_IMP_EXISTS_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- P ==> (?x.Q) = (?x'. P ==> (Q[x'/x]))
}
\noindent where {x'} is a primed variant of {x} that does not appear free in
the input term.

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term not of the form {P ==> (?x.Q)}.

@\DOC flat

\TYPE {Compat.flat : ('a list list -> 'a list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Flattens a list of lists into one long list.

\KEYWORDS
list.

\DESCRIBE
Found in the hol88 library. {flat [l1,...,ln]} returns {(l1 @@ ... @@ ln)} 
where each li is a list and {@@} is list concatenation.

\FAILURE
Never fails, unless the hol88 library has not been loaded.

\EXAMPLE
{
  - flat [[1,2],[3,4,5],[6]];
  [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6] : int list
}

\COMMENTS
{flat} is not in hol90; for some unknown reason, the author used {flatten} 
instead.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

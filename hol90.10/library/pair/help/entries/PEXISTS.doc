\TYPE {PEXISTS : ((term # term) -> thm -> thm)}

\KEYWORDS
rule, existential.

\LIBRARY pair

\SYNOPSIS
Introduces paired existential quantification given a particular witness.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a pair of terms and a theorem, where the first term a paired
existentially quantified pattern indicating the desired form of the result,
and the second a witness whose substitution for the quantified pair gives a
term which is the same as the conclusion of the theorem,
{PEXISTS} gives the desired theorem.
{
    A |- t[q/p]
   -------------  EXISTS ("?p. t","q")
    A |- ?p. t
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the substituted pattern is the same as the conclusion of the
theorem.

\EXAMPLE
The following examples illustrate the various uses of {PEXISTS}:
{
   #PEXISTS ("?x. x + 2 = x + 2", "1") (REFL "1 + 2");;
   |- ?x. x + 2 = x + 2

   #PEXISTS ("?y. 1 + y = 1 + y", "2") (REFL "1 + 2");;
   |- ?y. 1 + y = 1 + y

   #PEXISTS ("?(x,y). x + y = x + y", "(1,2)") (REFL "1 + 2");;
   |- ?(x,y). x + y = x + y

   #PEXISTS ("?(a:*,b:*). (a,b) = (a,b)", "ab:*#*") (REFL "ab:*#*");;
   |- ?(a,b). a,b = a,b
}

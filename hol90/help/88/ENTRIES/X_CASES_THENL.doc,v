@\DOC X_CASES_THENL

\TYPE {X_CASES_THENL : (term list list -> thm_tactic list -> thm_tactic)}

\SYNOPSIS
Applies theorem-tactics to corresponding disjuncts of a theorem, choosing
witnesses.

\KEYWORDS
theorem-tactic, cases, disjunction, quantifier, existential.

\DESCRIBE
Let {[yl1;...;yln]} represent a list of variable lists, each of length zero or
more, and {xl1,...,xln} each represent a vector of zero or more variables, so
that the variables in each of {yl1...yln} have the same types as the
corresponding {xli}. The function {X_CASES_THENL} expects a list of variable
lists, {[yl1;...;yln]}, a list of tactic-generating functions
{[f1;...;fn]:(thm->tactic)list}, and a disjunctive theorem, where each disjunct
may be existentially quantified:
{
   th = |-(?xl1.B1)  \/...\/  (?xln.Bn)
}
\noindent each disjunct having the form {(?xi1 ... xim. Bi)}. If applying each
{fi} to the theorem obtained by introducing witness variables {yli} for the
objects {xli} whose existence is asserted by the {i}th disjunct,
{({{Bi[yli/xli]}} |- Bi[yli/xli])}, produces the following results when applied
to a goal {(A ?- t)}:
{
    A ?- t
   =========  f1 ({{B1[yl1/xl1]}} |- B1[yl1/xl1])
    A ?- t1

    ...

    A ?- t
   =========  fn ({{Bn[yln/xln]}} |- Bn[yln/xln])
    A ?- tn
}
\noindent then applying {X_CASES_THENL [yl1;...;yln] [f1;...;fn] th}
to the goal {(A ?- t)} produces {n} subgoals.
{
           A ?- t
   =======================  X_CASES_THENL [yl1;...;yln] [f1;...;fn] th
    A ?- t1  ...  A ?- tn
}

\FAILURE
Fails (with {X_CASES_THENL}) if any {yli} has more variables than the
corresponding {xli}, or (with {SUBST}) if corresponding variables have
different types, or (with {combine}) if the number of theorem tactics
differs from the number of disjuncts.  Failures may arise in the
tactic-generating function.  An invalid tactic is produced if any
variable in any of the {yli} is free in the corresponding {Bi} or in
{t}, or if the theorem has any hypothesis which is not
alpha-convertible to an assumption of the goal.

\EXAMPLE
Given the goal {?- (x MOD 2) <= 1}, the following theorem may be
used to split into 2 cases:
{
   th = |- (?m. x = 2 * m) \/ (?m. x = (2 * m) + 1)
}
\noindent by the tactic
{X_CASES_THENL [["n:num"];["n:num"]] [ASSUME_TAC; SUBST1_TAC] th}
to produce the subgoals:
{
   ?- (((2 * n) + 1) MOD 2) <= 1

   {{x = 2 * n}} ?- (x MOD 2) <= 1
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

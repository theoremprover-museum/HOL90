@\DOC UNDISCH_ALL

\TYPE {UNDISCH_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively undischarges antecedents in a chain of implications.

\KEYWORDS
rule, undischarge, antecedent.

\DESCRIBE
{
    A |- t1 ==> ... ==> tn ==> t
   ------------------------------  UNDISCH_ALL
        A, t1, ..., tn |- t
}
\noindent Note that {UNDISCH_ALL} treats {"~u"} as {"u ==> F"}.

\FAILURE
Unlike {UNDISCH}, {UNDISCH_ALL} will,
when called on something other than an implication or negation,
return its argument unchanged rather than failing.

\COMMENTS
Identical terms which are repeated in {A, "t1", ..., "tn"} will
not be duplicated in the hypotheses of the resulting theorem.
However, if two or more alpha-equivalent terms appear in {A, "t1", ..., "tn"},
then each distinct term will appear in the result.

\SEEALSO
DISCH, DISCH_ALL, DISCH_TAC, DISCH_THEN, NEG_DISCH, FILTER_DISCH_TAC,
FILTER_DISCH_THEN, STRIP_TAC, UNDISCH, UNDISCH_TAC.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

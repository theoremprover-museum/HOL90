\DOC unlink

\TYPE {unlink : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Deletes a file.

\DESCRIBE
If {name} is the name of an existing file, then {unlink `name`} will remove
that file (if there are other links to the file, this will merely remove a
single link). Under Unix, the effect is the same as the {rm} command.

\FAILURE
A call to {unlink} may fail in various system-related ways, in particular if
{name} does not exist or the user does not have write permission for the
current directory.

\COMMENTS
This call is somewhat Unix-related, and may behave differently under other
operating systems.

\SEEALSO
link, system.

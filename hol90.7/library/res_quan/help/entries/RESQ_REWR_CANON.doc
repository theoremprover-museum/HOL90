\TYPE {RESQ_REWR_CANON : thm -> thm}

\SYNOPSIS
Transform a theorem into a form accepted for rewriting.

\KEYWORDS
derived rule, rewriting, conditional, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
{RESQ_REWR_CANON} transforms a theorem into a form accepted by {COND_REWR_TAC}.
The input theorem should be headed by a series of restricted universal
quantifications in the following form
{
   !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. u[xi] = v[xi])
}
\noindent Other variables occurring in {u} and {v} may be universally quantified.
The output theorem will have all ordinary universal quantifications
moved to the outer most level with possible renaming to prevent
variable capture, and have all restricted universal quantifications
converted to implications. The output theorem will be in the
form accepted by {COND_REWR_TAC}.

\FAILURE
This function fails is the input theorem is not in the correct form.

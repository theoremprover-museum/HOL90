@\DOC UNFOLD_RIGHT_RULE

\TYPE {UNFOLD_RIGHT_RULE : (thm list -> thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Expands sub-components of a hardware description using their definitions.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{UNFOLD_RIGHT_RULE thl} behaves as follows:
{
       A |- !z1 ... zr. t = ?y1 ... yp. t1 /\ ... /\ tn
   --------------------------------------------------------
    B u A |- !z1 ... zr. t = ?y1 ... yp. t1' /\ ... /\ tn'
}
\noindent where each {ti'} is the result of rewriting {ti} with the theorems in
{thl}. The set of assumptions {B} is the union of the instantiated assumptions
of the theorems used for rewriting. If none of the rewrites are applicable to
a {ti}, it is unchanged.

\FAILURE
Fails if the second argument is not of the required form, though either or
both of {r} and {p} may be zero.

\EXAMPLE
{
#UNFOLD_RIGHT_RULE [ASSUME "!in out. INV(in,out) = !(t:num). out t = ~(in t)"]
# (ASSUME "!(in:num->bool) out. BUF(in,out) = ?l. INV(in,l) /\ INV(l,out)");;
.. |- !in out.
       BUF(in,out) = (?l. (!t. l t = ~in t) /\ (!t. out t = ~l t))
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

<TITLE>The Syntax of HOL Expressions</TITLE>

<H1><A NAME = "Beginning">The Syntax of HOL Expressions</A></H1>

The basic language of the HOL logic is that of a typed lambda
calculus. This simple syntax is augmented with many constructs that make
expressions easier to input and to read. In the following, we discuss
various aspects of the syntax of terms: how to directly construct them
as well as how to parse and prettyprint them.

<LI> Type variables are like SML type variables:
<PRE>
    :* -> **
</PRE>

from hol88 would be

    :'a -> 'b

in hol90. Type constructors can be any identifier, <EM>i.e.</EM>, 
an alphabetic character followed by any number of alphanumeric characters.

<LI>

The lexical structure for term identifiers is also much like that for
SML: identifiers can be alphanumeric or symbolic. Variables must be 
alphanumeric. A symbolic identifier is any concatenation of the characters 
in the following list
<PRE>
    explode "#?+*/\\=<>&%@!,:;_|~-";
</PRE>

with the exception of the keywords
<PRE>
    ["\\", ";", "=>", "|", ":" ]
</PRE>

<LI>
Any alphanumeric can be a constant except the keywords
<PRE>
    [ "let", "in", "and", "of" ].
</PRE>

<LI>
There are also two infinite families of constants: numbers and strings
(if you have loaded the string library). Numbers are exactly the same as
in hol88, while strings are much like SML strings.
<P>

<LI>
The separator for enumerated lists and sets is ";", for example
<PRE>
    --`[1;2;3]`--
</PRE>
gives a three element list of type `:num list`.

<H2><A NAME = "Absyn">Functions for manipulating types and terms</A></H2>

hol90 supports a large number of primitive and derived functions for
building and manipulating types and terms. These are originally defined
in the modules

<A HREF = "manual.html#Type"><KBD>Type</KBD></A>,

<A HREF = "manual.html#Term"><KBD>Term</KBD></A>, and

<A HREF = "manual.html#Dsyntax"><KBD>Dsyntax</KBD></A> 

(which stands for "Derived syntax"). By and large, these functions have
<EM>record</EM> types. Some users have asked that these functions be
given <EM>tuple</EM> types, as in hol88. To meet these requests, we have
gathered up all the built in term manipulation functions that have
record types into two structures:

<A HREF = "manual.html#Psyntax"><KBD>Psyntax</KBD></A>
and 
<A HREF = "manual.html#Rsyntax"><KBD>Rsyntax</KBD></A>. 

These structures are variants of each other, featuring identical functions
with different types. The functions found in <KBD>Rsyntax</KBD> have 
record types, while those found in
<KBD>Psyntax</KBD> have tuple or curried types, as in hol88. The functions in
<KBD>Rsyntax</KBD> are initially in the pervasive environment. For example the
function "dest_abs" in the initial hol90 environment has type
<PRE>
    term -> {Bvar: term, Body :term}
</PRE>

Both paired and record versions may be intermixed through use of long
identifiers. Typically, a user will do either
<PRE>
    open Psyntax;
</PRE>
or
<PRE>
    open Rsyntax;
</PRE>

and work in whatever environment they find most comfortable.  Those who
write packages for general purpose use will need to bear this in mind
and, <EM>e.g.</EM>, ensure that their package does not make assumptions
about whether <KBD>Psyntax</KBD> or <KBD>Rsyntax</KBD> is open.

<H2><A NAME = "QAQ">Parsing and Quotation and Antiquotation</A></H2>

It is a bit tedious just to construct terms and types by direct
construction. To alleviate this, HOL systems come with parsers for the
type and term languages. These parsers come in various flavours, but all
are found in the <A HREF = "manual.html#Parse"><KBD>Parse</KBD>
structure</A>.  One important type of input to a parser is
quotations. <EM>Quotation</EM>, and its sibling <EM>antiquotation</EM>,
are features appearing in the original LCF system that have been ported
to SML/NJ. A quotation is delimited by backquote marks, for example

<PRE>
    `A /\ B`
</PRE>

In SML/NJ, quotations correspond to arbitrary object language
expressions and hence they are a more general notion than in LCF and
hol88, where a quotation can only be either a type or term. There can be
quotations from many different object languages in the same SML/NJ
session. A consequence of this is that quotations must be parsed
explicitly, instead of implicitly, as in hol88. For example, the above 
quotation could be parsed as:
<PRE>
    Parse.term_parser `A /\ B`
</PRE>
or, since the function "--" is a bit of syntactic sugaring for term_parser
(suggested by Richard Boulton of Cambridge University), as
<PRE>
    --`A /\ B`--
</PRE>

Similarly, types could be parsed as 
<PRE>
    Parse.type_parser `:(bool -> 'a) -> ('a # 'b) list`
</PRE>
or as
<PRE>
    ==`:(bool -> 'a) -> ('a # 'b) list`==
</PRE>

One nicety of the system is that the hol90 prettyprinter will 
automatically surround a term or type with syntax that will re-parse it:
<PRE>
    - Parse.term_parser `X \/ Y`;
    val it = (--`X \/ Y`--) : term
</PRE>

This can be modified by altering the variables
<PRE>
      Globals.type_pp_prefix     (* initially "(--"  *)
      Globals.type_pp_suffix     (* initially "--)"  *)
      Globals.term_pp_prefix     (* initially "(=="  *)
      Globals.term_pp_suffix     (* initially "==)"  *)
</PRE>
<P>

<H2>Antiquotation</H2>

For terms, antiquotes are much the same as in hol88. So 
<PRE>
    val tm = --`A /\ B`--;
    val tm' = --`C /\ ^tm`--;
</PRE>

gives the same result as parsing 
<PRE>
    val tm' = --`C /\ A /\ B`--
</PRE>

For types, it is necessary to use a somewhat more devious approach: if you are
going to use a type as an antiquotation, you must wrap the constructor
<KBD>ty_antiq</KBD> around it:
<PRE>
    val ty = ty_antiq(==`:('a -> 'b) -> 'a list -> 'b list`==)
    val tm = --`(MAP:^ty) f`--;
</PRE>

In hol90, type antiquotations are needed to get the effect of type
abbreviations in hol88.

<H2><A NAME = "Precedence">Precedence</A></H2>

Infixes in hol90 have precedence, and associate to the right, e.g.,
if "op" is an infix, then
<PRE>
    A op B op C 
</PRE>

parses to the same term as
<PRE>
    A op (B op C). 
</PRE>

Functions that introduce constants into the system have systematically
been upgraded to include the parsing status of the constant. For
example,
<PRE>
  val new_infix : {Name:string,  Ty:hol_type, Prec:int} -> unit

  val new_specification 
     :{name:string, sat_thm:thm,
       consts:{const_name:string, fixity:fixity} list}
      -> thm

  val new_recursive_definition 
     :{def:term, fixity:fixity, 
       name:string, rec_axiom:thm} -> thm

  val define_type
     : {fixities:fixity list, name:string, 
        type_spec:term frag list} -> thm

</PRE>
where <KBD>fixity</KBD> is described by the following datatype:
<PRE>
    datatype fixity = Prefix | Binder | Infix of int
</PRE>

To give constant <EM>c1</EM> a higher precedence than constant <EM>c2</EM>, 
give it a higher number. The current precedences are
<PRE>
          $,  ---> 50
          $=  ---> 100
        $==>  ---> 200
         $\/  ---> 300
         $/\  ---> 400
      $>, $<  ---> 450
    $>=, $<=  ---> 450
      $+, $-  ---> 500
    $*, $DIV  ---> 600
        $MOD  ---> 650
        $EXP  ---> 700
        $o    ---> 800
</PRE>
For the library "sets", the precedences are
<PRE>
         $IN  ---> 450
     $SUBSET  ---> 450
    $PSUBSET  ---> 450
      $UNION  ---> 500
       $DIFF  ---> 500
     $INSERT  ---> 500
     $DELETE  ---> 500
      $INTER  ---> 600
</PRE>
The hol90 prettyprinter also uses precedence to eliminate as many
brackets as possible.

<H2><A NAME = "How terms are parsed">How terms are parsed</A></H2>

The information in this section is probably too detailed to include in a
user manual; it is included anyway, for those intrepid users who want to
know a bit more detail.  Terms are currently parsed in 4 passes. The
first pass leaves us with a structure where everything is associated to
the left, conforming to the fact that application associates to the left
and is highest in the precedence pecking order. The second pass sorts
out the precedences of the user-defined infixes. This leaves us in the
type of preterms.

<P>

The third pass is type inference. Type inference is by a variant of
Milner's algorithm W; unification of types is done by Robinson's
side-effecting unification algorithm. The declaration of hol_type allows
two kinds of type variables: user and system. A user-given type variable
is treated as a type constant during unification: it would be
frustrating to constrain a term to have a certain type, only to have
that type change by unification. A system type variable is modifiable by
unification, but may not persist after the end of parsing.
<P>
The last pass removes dollarsigns from atom names and checks that all
type variables are constrained. This pass maps from preterms to terms.

<H3>How precedence is enforced (gory detail)</H3>

As already explained, the first pass of parsing has left us with a
structure where everything is associated to the left, conforming to the
fact that application associates to the left and is highest in the
precedence pecking order.  For us, all infixes associate to the right,
with differing precedences.  (The only exception to this is negation
(<STRONG>~</STRONG>), a prefix operator.)
<P>
So we have the following <KBD>preterm</KBD> structure:
<PRE>
    (...((<VAR>X</VAR> <VAR>f</VAR>) <VAR>arg</VAR>))
</PRE>

Since we have not "flipped" infixes to be prefixes yet, if the above
expression is an infixed expression, <VAR>f</VAR> will be an infix
constant, with (naively) <VAR>X</VAR> as its left arm and <VAR>arg</VAR>
as its right arm. If we have an "infix chain", i.e., <VAR>X</VAR> is
itself of the form <KBD>(...((<VAR>X'</VAR> <VAR>g)</VAR>
<VAR>arg'</VAR>))</KBD>, with <VAR>g</VAR> infix, then we have a tug-o-war
between <VAR>f</VAR> and <VAR>g</VAR> for <VAR>arg'</VAR>. There are two
cases, based on the precedences of <VAR>f</VAR> and <VAR>g</VAR>:

<OL>

<LI>
 The precedence of <VAR>g</VAR> is strictly larger than <VAR>f</VAR>.
Then <VAR>arg'</VAR> forms the right arm of <VAR>g</VAR>. The left arm
of <VAR>g</VAR> is a suffix of <VAR>X'</VAR>. Then <KBD>((<VAR>g</VAR>
<VAR>left_arm</VAR>) <VAR>arg'</VAR>)</KBD> becomes the left arm to
<VAR>f</VAR>: 
<PRE>
  ((<VAR>f</VAR> ((<VAR>g</VAR> <VAR>left_arm</VAR>) <VAR>arg'</VAR>)) <VAR>arg</VAR>)
</PRE>

<LI> Otherwise. <VAR>arg'</VAR> goes into <KBD>((<VAR>f</VAR>
<VAR>arg'</VAR>) <VAR>arg</VAR>)</KBD>, which forms the right arm for
<VAR>g</VAR>.

</OL>

We have glossed a bit, since at the time of looking at an infix, it is
not possible to know what its left arm will be, so we put the infix and
its right arm on a stack. We then move to the left in the term. Assume
the next template is that of an infix: we have the two cases above. In
case 1, we already have <KBD><<VAR>f</VAR>,<VAR>arg</VAR>></KBD> on the
stack; we push <KBD><<VAR>g</VAR>,<VAR>arg'</VAR>></KBD> on top of that and
continue. In case 2, we pop <KBD><<VAR>f</VAR>,<VAR>arg</VAR>></KBD> off
the stack and make <KBD><<VAR>g</VAR>,((<VAR>f</VAR> <VAR>arg'</VAR>)
<VAR>arg</VAR>)></KBD>. We continue popping the stack and making values
until we empty the stack or we encounter a
<KBD><<VAR>h</VAR>,<VAR>tm</VAR>></KBD> pair on the stack with a
precedence strictly less than <VAR>g</VAR>.

<P>

How does this terminate? When we run into a situation that doesn't meet
the <KBD>(...((<VAR>X</VAR> <VAR>f</VAR>) <VAR>arg</VAR>))</KBD>
template. In that case, we unwind the stack by using a "dummy infix"
with binding value less than anything on the stack.

<P>

<H4>Example</H4>

Suppose that we have declared infixes <STRONG>&</STRONG>,
<STRONG>+</STRONG>, <STRONG>=</STRONG>, and <STRONG>?</STRONG>, with
the relative precedences being (<KBD><STRONG>&</STRONG> >
<STRONG>+</STRONG></KBD>), (<KBD><STRONG>+</STRONG> >
<STRONG>?</STRONG></KBD>), and (<KBD><STRONG>?</STRONG> >
<STRONG>=</STRONG></KBD>).  Our example is

<PRE>
    A & B + C & D = A ? B + C ? D
</PRE>

Since there are no nested applications, we can treat this as a string.
Put <KBD><?,D></KBD> on the stack, the lookahead (LA) is
<KBD>+C</KBD>. Since <KBD>+ > ?</KBD>, we push <KBD><+,C></KBD> onto the
stack and the algorithm traces as follows:
<PRE>

     LA            stack
     -------------------
     +C            <?,D>

     ?B            <+,C>
                   <?,D>

                   <?,((+ B) C)>
                   <?,D>

     =A            <?,((? ((+ B) C)) D)>

     &D            <=,((? A) ((? ((+ B) C)) D))>

     +C            <&,D>
                   <=,((? A) ((? ((+ B) C)) D))>

     &B            <+,((& C) D)>
                   <=,((? A) ((? ((+ B) C)) D))>

      A            <&,B>
                   <+,((& C) D)>
                   <=,((? A) ((? ((+ B) C)) D))>
</PRE>

Now unwind, by filling in all left hand sides on the stack.
<PRE>
    1. ((& A) B)
    2. ((+ ((& A) B)) ((& C) D))
    3. ((= ((+ ((& A) B)) ((& C) D)))
        ((? A) ((? ((+ B) C)) D)))
</PRE>
If we pretty printed the result, we would get
<PRE>
    (A & B) + (C & D) = A ? ((B + C) ? D)
</PRE>

<UL>
<LI>
The inclusion of ":" in the "symbolics" means that some constraints may
need to be separated by white space. For example
<PRE>
    $=:bool->bool->bool
</PRE>

will be broken up by the lexer as
<PRE>
    $=: bool -> bool -> bool
</PRE>

and parsed as an application of the symbolic identifier "$=:" to
the term argument list ["bool", "->", "bool", "->", "bool"]. But
<PRE>
    $= :bool->bool->bool
</PRE>

is OK, being parsed as the symbolic identifier "=" constrained by a
type. 
<P>

<LI>

Another special case is that of <KBD>~</KBD>, which is used for
negation. It is the only prefix parsed identifier in the system. For
example, the usual parsing of <KBD>`A B C`</KBD> is equivalent to
<KBD>`(A B) C`</KBD>, since application is viewed as an invisible left
associative infix operator with the top binding power. However, parsing
<KBD>`~ ~ A`</KBD> is equivalent to parsing <KBD>`~ (~
A)`</KBD>. Furthermore, the tilde is really in a lexical class of its
own, since it "breaks up" symbolic identifiers it's with (including
itself): for example, if we take <KBD>_|_</KBD> as an existing symbolic
constant, then <KBD>`~~_|_`</KBD> is equivalent to <KBD>`~(~( _|_
))`</KBD>. There is a "lexical shenanigan" that one can play to add
identifiers with tilde as symbolic identifiers: add the lexeme of
interest to the list referenced by the variable
<KBD>Globals.tilde_symbols</KBD>. For example,

<PRE>
    Globals.tilde_symbols := ["~*"];
    new_infix{Name = "~*", 
              Ty   = `:bool -> bool -> bool`, 
              Prec = 450}
</PRE>

allows <KBD>`A ~* B`</KBD> to parse happily. Adding a "tilde"d symbolic
identifier to the <KBD>tilde_symbols</KBD> suppresses the special nature
of tilde in the symbolic identifier.

A difference in the parsing of hol88 and hol90 is how type
constraints work with infixes. In hol88 
<PRE>
    <VAR>term</VAR> <VAR>infix</VAR> <VAR>term</VAR> <STRONG>:</STRONG> <VAR>hol_type</VAR>
</PRE>
gets bracketed thus:
<PRE>
    <VAR>term</VAR> <VAR>infix</VAR> <STRONG>(</STRONG><VAR>term</VAR> <STRONG>:</STRONG> <VAR>hol_type</VAR><STRONG>)</STRONG>
</PRE>
whereas in hol90, it is equivalent to the following parse:
<PRE>
    <STRONG>(</STRONG><VAR>term</VAR> <VAR>infix</VAR> <VAR>term</VAR><STRONG>)</STRONG> <STRONG>:</STRONG> <VAR>hol_type</VAR>
</PRE>

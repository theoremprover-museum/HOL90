\DOC lisp

\TYPE {lisp : (string -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Executes a lisp command from ML.

\DESCRIBE
{lisp} executes a lisp s-expression (written as an ML string).  Returned
values do not appear on the standard output, unless they are explicitly
printed.

\FAILURE
Fails if the s-expression is improperly constructed or fails when
evaluated by lisp.

\EXAMPLE
{
#lisp `(princ "hello")`;;
hello() : void

#lisp `(cons 'a 'b)`;;
() : void

#lisp `(princ (cons 'a 'b))`;;
(A . B)() : void

#lisp `(car 'a)`;;
Error: Attempt to take the car of A which is not a cons.
evaluation failed     lisp -- NIL

#lisp `(princ "hello"`;;
Error: eof encountered on input stream #<string input stream  @ #x869fe6>
evaluation failed     lisp -- NIL
}
\COMMENTS
{lisp} is not meant for general use, and should be treated with great
care.  If one is not wary, it is entirely possible to corrupt HOL by
using it.

\TYPE {inst : (term list -> (type # type) list -> term -> term)}

\SYNOPSIS
Performs type instantiations in a term, avoiding certain ones.

\DESCRIBE
The function {inst} should be used as follows:
{
   inst [tm1;...;tmn] [(t1',t1);...;(tn',tn)] tm
}
\noindent where {tm1...tmn} are variables, {t1...tn,t1'...tn'} types and {tm} a
term to be type-instantiated. This call will instantiate, in parallel, the
types {t1'...tn'} for the types {t1...tn} wherever they appear in {tm}
(possibly nowhere). However, if the name (not necessarily the type) of any
variable being instantiated matches one of the {[tm1...tmn]}, it will be
renamed (by adding primes) prior to the instantiation. This is useful to avoid
obscure problems of free variable capture when type-instantiating theorems.

\FAILURE
Fails if the instantiation list is non-empty and some of the {tm1...tmn} are
not simply variables.

\EXAMPLE
{
#inst [] [(":num",":*")] "(x:*) = (x:*)";;
"x = x" : term

#inst ["x:bool"] [(":num",":*")] "(x:*) = (x:*)";;
"x' = x'" : term

#inst [] [(":num",":bool")] "x:bool";;
"x" : term

#type_of it;;
":num" : type
}
\USES
Performing internal functions connected with type instantiation.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {load : ((string # bool) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Loads ML phrases from the named file.

\DESCRIBE
A call {load(`file`,flag)} will load ML phrases from the file described by
{file}. If the boolean value {flag} is true, then toplevel printing of the
system responses will occur, otherwise just a dot is printed for each toplevel
phrase. The name {file} is expanded into a real filename using the same
mechanism as {find_ml_file}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the appropriate file cannot be found on the search path, or if an
error occurs in the ML which is being loaded.

\COMMENTS
It is usual to use either {loadf} or {loadt} rather than this function, which
perform the same action with one or the other setting of the flag.

\SEEALSO
find_ml_file, loadf, loadt, search_path, set_search_path.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

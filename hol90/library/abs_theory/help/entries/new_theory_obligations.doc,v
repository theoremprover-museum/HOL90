\TYPE {new_theory_obligations : (string # term) -> void}

\LIBRARY {abs_theory}

\SYNOPSIS
Declares new theory obligations.


\DESCRIBE 
A call to {new_theory_obligations stp} adds the theory obligation in
{stp} to theory obligation list in the current theory, where {stp}
is a string--term pair where the first string is the name of the obligation
and the term is a predicate that must be met for an instantiation to be
valid. 

\USES
Declaring theory obligations for an abstract object declared in an abstract
theory.

\FAILURE
Fails if a term in {stp} is not a predicate.

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

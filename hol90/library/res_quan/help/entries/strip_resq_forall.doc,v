\TYPE {strip_resq_forall : (term -> ((term # term) list # term))}

\SYNOPSIS
Iteratively breaks apart a restricted universally quantified term.

\DESCRIBE
{strip_resq_forall} is an iterative term destructor for restricted universal
quantifications. It iteratively breaks apart a restricted universally
quantified term into a list of pairs which are the restricted quantified
variables and predicates and the body.
{
   strip_resq_forall "!x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t"
}
\noindent returns {([("x1","P1");...;("xn","Pn")],"t")}.

\FAILURE

log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

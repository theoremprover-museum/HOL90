\DOC PSPEC_PAIR

\TYPE {PSPEC_PAIR : (thm -> (term # thm))}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem, returning the chosen variant.

\KEYWORDS
rule.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !p. t}, the inference rule {PSPEC_PAIR}
returns the term {q'} and the theorem {A |- t[q'/p]}, where {q'} is a variant
of {p} chosen to avoid free variable capture.
{
     A |- !p. t
   --------------  PSPEC_PAIR
    A |- t[q'/q]
}
\FAILURE
Fails unless the theorem's conclusion is a paired universal quantification.

\COMMENTS
This rule is very similar to plain {PSPEC}, except that it returns the
variant chosen, which may be useful information under some circumstances.

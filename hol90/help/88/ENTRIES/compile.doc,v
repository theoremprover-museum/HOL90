\TYPE {compile : ((string # bool) -> void)}

\SYNOPSIS
Compiles the named ML source file.

\DESCRIBE
Given a pair {(`name`,flag)}, {compile} loads the named file and then compiles
it into LISP, generating a file {name_ml.l}. It then calls the LISP compiler to
create an object file {name_ml.o}. The intermediate LISP file is automatically
deleted once the {name_ml.o} file has been generated. If {flag} is {true}, a
verbose account of the compilation is generated, if {flag} is {false},
compilation is silent.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named {ML} source file does not exist, or if the load is
unsuccessful. In the latter case, the intermediate {name_ml.l} file is
left undeleted.

\EXAMPLE
To compile two files {a.ml} and {b.ml}, where {b.ml} depends on definitions
made in {a.ml}, one can type:
{
   #compile (`a`,true);;
   #compile (`b`,true);;
}
\noindent Suppose one exists the {HOL} session and attempts to
load the files in a new session:
{
   #load(`a`,false);;
   [fasl a_ml.o]
   #load(`b`,false);;
   [fasl b_ml.o]
}
\noindent Note that {load} always loads an object file if one exists,
regardless of its creation date. Loading {a_ml.o} sets up the static bindings
necessary for {b_ml.o} to run. File {b.ml} may be edited without recompilation
of {a.ml}, however, if {a.ml} is edited and recompiled, then {b.ml} has to be
recompiled before being used. Consequently, if the {ML} code built into the
system is recompiled, users have to recompile all their programs.

\COMMENTS
Compiled {ML} runs faster than interpreted {ML}, and loads almost
instantaneously.

There is a potential problem with compiling code that mentions the names of
theorems set up to be autoloaded.  Suppose a file {f.ml} is to be compiled and
contains the following code:
{
   let f x = SPEC x num_CASES;;
}
\noindent where {num_CASES} is a built-in theorem which is set up to be
autoloaded on demand.  If, in a given session, the theorem {num_CASES} has
already been autoloaded before the file {f.ml} is compiled, then the resulting
object code will not itself autoload this theorem; it will just evaluate a
compiled version of the identifier {num_CASES} when the function {f} is called.
In particular, an unbound identifier error will occur if the compiled file
{f_ml.o} is loaded in a separate session and the function {f} is then called.

To get around this problem, one should rewrite functions that refer to
autoloaded values so that they explicitly fetch the required theorems from
disk. In general, one must arrange for code to be compiled not to invoke any
autoloading action.  For the example shown above, this could be done by
defining the function {f} as follows.
{
   let f =
       let thm = theorem `arithmetic` `num_CASES` in
       \x. SPEC x thm;;
}
\noindent Note that {thm} in this definition is not the name of any
automatically autoloaded theorem.  Note also that it would be most
undesirable to define {f} by:
{
   let f x =
       let thm = theorem `arithmetic` `num_CASES` in
       SPEC x thm;;
}
\noindent With this definition, function {f} fetches {num_CASES} off disk each
time it is called, rather than just once when it is defined.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

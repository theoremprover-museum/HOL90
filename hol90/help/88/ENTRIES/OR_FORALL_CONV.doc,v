@\DOC OR_FORALL_CONV

\TYPE {OR_FORALL_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Moves a universal quantification outwards through a disjunction.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, quantifier, universal, disjunction.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a term of the form {(!x.P) \/ (!x.Q)}, where {x} is free
in neither {P} nor {Q}, {OR_FORALL_CONV} returns the theorem:
{
   |- (!x. P) \/ (!x. Q) = (!x. P \/ Q)
}
\FAILURE
{OR_FORALL_CONV} fails if it is applied to a term not of the form
{(!x.P) \/ (!x.Q)}, or if it is applied to a term {(!x.P) \/ (!x.Q)}
in which the variable {x} is free in either {P} or {Q}.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

\TYPE {find_ml_file: (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Searches for a named {ML} file.

\DESCRIBE
Given a {`.ml`} suffixed string {`foo.ml`}, {find_ml_file} searches for the
{ML} source file {foo.ml}. If the given string does not have a {`.ml`} suffix,
then {find_ml_file} searches for the object file {foo_ml.o} or the {ML} source
file {foo.ml}. If the object file exists, then its name is returned.
Otherwise, the name of the {ML} source file is returned if it
exists.

\FAILURE
Fails if the appropriate file cannot be found using the current search path.

\EXAMPLE
{
#find_ml_file `foo`;;
`foo_ml.o` : string

#find_ml_file `foo.ml`;;
`foo.ml` : string
}
\USES
Typically used to determine whether an object file exists for a named {ML}
source file.

\TYPE {is_letter : (string -> bool)}

\SYNOPSIS
Tests whether a character is a letter.

\DESCRIBE
When given a string, which should be of length 1, {is_letter} returns
{true} iff the character is a letter. By default this means what one
would expect, namely one of {a..z A..Z}. However the scope of the
definition can be increased using {new_letter}.

\FAILURE
Fails if the string has length greater than 1. Returns {false} for the
null string ({``}).

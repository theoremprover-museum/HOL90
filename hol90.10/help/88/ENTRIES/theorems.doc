\TYPE {theorems : (string -> (string # thm) list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Returns the derived theorems of a given theory segment of the current theory.

\DESCRIBE
A call of {theorems `thy`} returns the derived theorems of the theory segment
{thy} together with their names. The theory segment {thy} must be part of
the current theory. The names are those given to the theorems by the user when
they were originally added to the theory segment (by, for example, a call to
{save_thm}). The name of the current theory segment can be abbreviated by {`-`}.

\FAILURE
The call {theorems `thy`} will fail if the theory segment {thy} is not part
of the current theory.

\EXAMPLE
{
#theorems `bool`;;
[(`PAIR_EQ`, |- !x y a b. (x,y = a,b) = (x = a) /\ (y = b));
 (`SND`, |- !x y. SND(x,y) = y);
 (`FST`, |- !x y. FST(x,y) = x);
 (`PAIR`, |- !x. FST x,SND x = x);
 (`PAIR_EXISTS`, |- ?p. IS_PAIR p)]
: (string # thm) list

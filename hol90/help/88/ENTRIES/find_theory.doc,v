@\DOC find_theory

\TYPE {find_theory : (string -> string)}

\SYNOPSIS
Attempts to find a named theory.

\DESCRIBE
Given a string {`foo`}, {find_theory} attempts to find the theory file
{`foo.th`} using the current search path. If it succeeds, it returns a full
pathname (possibly a relative pathname identical to the argument string).

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory file cannot be found using the current search path.

\EXAMPLE
{
#find_theory `num`;;
`/usr/groups/hol/HOL2/sun4_sos/theories/num.th` : string
}
\SEEALSO
find_file, find_ml_file, search_path, set_search_path.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

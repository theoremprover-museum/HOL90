\TYPE {Not : (thmpattern -> thmpattern)}

\SYNOPSIS
Generates a pattern that matches if the argument pattern does not match.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
Note that {Not} throws away binding information. So, one cannot test the
bindings of pattern variables occurring in the pattern used as argument to
{Not} (at least not from outside the {Not}).

\FAILURE
Never fails.

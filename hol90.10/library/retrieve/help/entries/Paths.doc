\SYNOPSIS
Generates a source for a search from a list of search paths.

\LIBRARY retrieve

\DESCRIBE
A {source} for a search can be either a list of search paths, or a list of
theorems found on a previous search. {Paths} generates a {source} of the first
kind. The search paths in such a {source} are searched in sequence.

\FAILURE
Never fails.

\EXAMPLE
To search the ancestry of the theories `{theory1}' and `{theory2}' in
`parallel', one would use the source:
{
   Paths [Ancestors (["theory1","theory2"],[])]
}
\noindent To search them in sequence, one would use:
{
   Paths [Ancestors (["theory1"],[]), Ancestors (["theory2"],[])]
}

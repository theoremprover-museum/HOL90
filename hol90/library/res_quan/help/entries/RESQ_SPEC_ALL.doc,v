@\DOC RESQ_SPEC_ALL

\TYPE {RESQ_SPEC_ALL : (thm -> thm)}

\SYNOPSIS
Specializes the conclusion of a theorem with its own restricted
quantified variables.

\KEYWORDS
rule, restricted quantifier.

\DESCRIBE
When applied to a theorem {A |- !x1::P1. ...!xn::Pn. t},
the inference rule {RESQ_SPEC_ALL}
returns the theorem {A,P1 x1',...,Pn xn' |- t[x1'/x1]...[xn'/xn]}
 where the {xi'} are distinct
variants of the corresponding {xi}, chosen to avoid clashes with any variables
free in the assumption list and with the names of constants. Normally {xi'} is
just {xi}, in which case {RESQ_SPEC_ALL} simply removes all restricted
 universal quantifiers.
{
       A |- !x1::P1. ... !xn::Pn. t
   -------------------------------------------  RESQ_SPEC_ALL
    A,P1 x1,...,Pn xn |- t[x1'/x1]...[xn'/xn]
}

\FAILURE
Never fails.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

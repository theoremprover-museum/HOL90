@\DOC EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV

\TYPE {EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Proves that a nonempty bounded set of natural numbers has a greatest element.

\KEYWORDS
conversion, number.

\DESCRIBE
The call
{
   EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV "(?x. P[x]) /\ (?y. !z. z > y ==> ~P[z])"
}
\noindent returns the theorem
{
   (?x. P[x]) /\ (?y. !z. z > y ==> ~P[z]) = ?x. P[x] /\ !z. z > x ==> ~P[z]
}
\noindent This expresses the equivalence of the statements `a property {P}
is true for some number {x}, and there is a limit {y} beyond which {P} is not
true' and `there is a greatest number such that {P} is true'.

\FAILURE
{EXISTS_GREATEST_CONV tm} fails unless {tm} has the form specified above.

\SEEALSO
EXISTS_LEAST_CONV.

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

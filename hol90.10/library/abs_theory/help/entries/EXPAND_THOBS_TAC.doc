\SYNOPSIS 
Expands a goal using the abstract definition and theory
obligations for the named theory.

\DESCRIBE When applied to a goal {A ?- thob_def(rep)}, where
{thob_def} is a theory obligation and {rep} is a representation, the
tactic expands the definition of the theory obligation and reduces the
terms resulting from the abstract definitions.  This tactic is usually the
first step in proving that a given representation meets the abstract theory
obligations.

\FAILURE
Fails if the named theory is not an ancestor.

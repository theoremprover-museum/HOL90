@\DOC string_EQ_CONV

\TYPE {string_EQ_CONV : conv}

\SYNOPSIS
Decision-procedure for equality of string constants.

\DESCRIBE 
The conversion {string_EQ_CONV} expects its term argument to be an equation of
the form {"lhs = rhs"}, where {lhs} and {rhs} are both character string
constants (for example: {"`a`"}, {"`b`"}, {"`abc`"}, etc).  Given such a term,
the conversion {string_EQ_CONV} returns:
{
   |- (lhs = rhs) = T
}
\noindent if {lhs} and {rhs} are identical character strings.  Otherwise, the
conversion returns:
{
   |- (lhs = rhs) = F
}

\FAILURE
Fails if applied to a term that is not of the form shown above.

\EXAMPLE
{
#string_EQ_CONV "`aax` = `aay`";;
|- (`aax` = `aay`) = F
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

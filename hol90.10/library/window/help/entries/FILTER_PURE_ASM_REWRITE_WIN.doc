\SYNOPSIS
Repeatedly rewrite the focus with selected context and theorems.

\LIBRARY window

\DESCRIBE
{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} repeatedly rewrites the focus of
the top window with {thms} and those theorems in the context of the
window, the conclusions of which satisfy the predicate {p}.

\FAILURE
{FILTER_PURE_ASM_REWRITE_WIN p thms} will fail if the hypotheses of
any of the theorems in {thms} are not a subset of the conjectures of
the window. This function may fail to terminate if {thms}, or the
selected terms in the context, describe a circular rewriting.

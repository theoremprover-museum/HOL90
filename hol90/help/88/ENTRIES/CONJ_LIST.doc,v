@\DOC CONJ_LIST

\TYPE {CONJ_LIST : (int -> thm -> thm list)}

\SYNOPSIS
Extracts a list of conjuncts from a theorem (non-flattening version).

\KEYWORDS
rule, conjunction.

\DESCRIBE
{CONJ_LIST} is the proper inverse of {LIST_CONJ}. Unlike {CONJUNCTS} which
recursively splits as many conjunctions as possible both to the left and to
the right, {CONJ_LIST} splits the top-level conjunction and then splits
(recursively) only the right conjunct. The integer argument is required
because the term {tn} may itself be a conjunction. A list of {n} theorems is
returned.
{
    A |- t1 /\ (t2 /\ ( ... /\ tn)...)
   ------------------------------------  CONJ_LIST n (A |- t1 /\ ... /\ tn)
    A |- t1   A |- t2   ...   A |- tn
}
\FAILURE
Fails if the integer argument ({n}) is less than one, or if the input theorem
has less than {n} conjuncts.

\EXAMPLE
Suppose the identifier {th} is bound to the theorem:
{
   A |- (x /\ y) /\ z /\ w
}
\noindent Here are some applications of {CONJ_LIST} to {th}:
{
   #CONJ_LIST 0 th;;
   evaluation failed     CONJ_LIST

   #CONJ_LIST 1 th;;
   [A |- (x /\ y) /\ z /\ w] : thm list

   #CONJ_LIST 2 th;;
   [A |- x /\ y; A |- z /\ w] : thm list

   #CONJ_LIST 3 th;;
   [A |- x /\ y; A |- z; A |- w] : thm list

   #CONJ_LIST 4 th;;
   evaluation failed     CONJ_LIST
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.

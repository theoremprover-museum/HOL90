@\DOC EXPAND_AUTO_CONV

\TYPE {EXPAND_AUTO_CONV : (thm list -> conv)}

\SYNOPSIS
Unfolds, then unwinds as much as possible, then prunes the unwound lines.

\LIBRARY unwind

\DESCRIBE
{EXPAND_AUTO_CONV thl} when applied to the following term:
{
   "?l1 ... lm. t1 /\ ... /\ ui1 /\ ... /\ uik /\ ... /\ tn"
}
\noindent returns a theorem of the form:
{
   B |- (?l1 ... lm. t1 /\ ... /\ ui1 /\ ... /\ uik /\ ... /\ tn) =
        (?li(k+1) ... lim. t1' /\ ... /\ tn')
}
\noindent where each {ti'} is the result of rewriting {ti} with the theorems in
{thl}. The set of assumptions {B} is the union of the instantiated assumptions
of the theorems used for rewriting. If none of the rewrites are applicable to a
conjunct, it is unchanged. After rewriting, the function decides which of the
resulting terms to use for unwinding, by performing a loop analysis on the
graph representing the dependencies of the lines.

Suppose the function decides to unwind {li1,...,lik} using the terms
{ui1',...,uik'} respectively. Then, after unwinding, the lines {li1,...,lik}
are pruned (provided they have been eliminated from the right-hand sides of the
conjuncts that are equations, and from the whole of any other conjuncts)
resulting in the elimination of {ui1',...,uik'}.

The {li}'s are related by the equation:
{
   {{li1,...,lik}} u {{li(k+1),...,lim}} = {{l1,...,lm}}
}
\noindent The loop analysis allows the term to be unwound as much as possible
without the risk of looping. The user is left to deal with the recursive
equations.

\FAILURE
The function may fail if the argument term is not of the specified form. It
also fails if there is more than one equation for any line variable.

\EXAMPLE
{
#EXPAND_AUTO_CONV
# [ASSUME "!in out. INV (in,out) = !(t:num). out t = ~(in t)"]
# "?l1 l2.
#   INV (l1,l2) /\ INV (l2,out) /\ (!(t:num). l1 t = l2 (t-1) \/ out (t-1))";;
. |- (?l1 l2.
       INV(l1,l2) /\ INV(l2,out) /\ (!t. l1 t = l2(t - 1) \/ out(t - 1))) =
     (?l2.
       (!t. l2 t = ~(l2(t - 1) \/ ~l2(t - 1))) /\ (!t. out t = ~l2 t))
}

1.1.1.1
log
@Sources of hol90.7 as released, cleaned up by R.J.Boulton and D.R.Syme.

Summary of changes:

 * "contrib" directory not included
 * Machine-generatable files deleted, e.g. .dvi, .ps, .thms, .holsig, .hol_lib
 * Some directory restructuring in "library", in particular help files for
   ML functions have been put in a help/entries subdirectory in cases where
   they were originally in the help directory itself.
